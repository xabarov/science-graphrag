# TOOD: Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection

## Abstract

One-stage object detection is commonly implemented by
optimizing two sub-tasks: object classification and localiza-
tion, using heads with two parallel branches, which might
lead to a certain level of spatial misalignment in predic-
tions between the two tasks. In this work, we propose a
Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that ex-
plicitly aligns the two tasks in a learning-based manner.
First, we design a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head) which
offers a better balance between learning task-interactive
and task-specific features, as well as a greater flexibility to
learn the alignment via a task-aligned predictor. Second,
we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL) to explicitly pull
closer (or even unify) the optimal anchors for the two tasks
during training via a designed sample assignment scheme
and a task-aligned loss. Extensive experiments are con-
ducted on MS-COCO, where TOOD achieves a 51.1 AP at
single-model single-scale testing. This surpasses the recent
one-stage detectors by a large margin, such as ATSS [31]
(47.7 AP), GFL [14] (48.2 AP), and PAA [9] (49.0 AP),
with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Qualitative results also
demonstrate the effectiveness of TOOD for better aligning
the tasks of object classification and localization. Code is
available at https://github.com/fcjian/TOOD.

## Body

1. Introduction
Object detection aims to localize and recognize objects
of interest from natural images, and is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. It is commonly formu-
lated as a multi-task learning problem by jointly optimizing
object classification and localization [4, 6, 7, 16, 22, 33].
The classification task is designed to learn discriminative
features that focus on the key or salient part of an object,

Result Score IoU
Figure 1. Illustration of detection results (‘Result’) and spatial
distributions of classification scores (‘Score’) and localization
scores (‘IoU’) predicted by ATSS [31] (top row) and the proposed
TOOD (bottom row). Ground-truth is indicated by yellow boxes,
and a white arrow means the main direction of the best anchor
away from the center of an object. In the ‘Result’ column, a
red/green patch is the location of the best anchor for classifica-
tion/localization, while a red/green box means an object bounding
box predicted from the anchor in the red/green patch (if they coin-
cide, we only show the red patches and boxes).
while the localization task works on precisely locating the
whole object with its boundaries. Due to the divergence
of learning mechanisms for classification and localization,
spatial distributions of the learned features by the two tasks
can be different, causing a certain level of misalignment
when predictions are made by using two separate branches.
Recent one-stage object detectors attempted to predict
consistent outputs of the two separate tasks, by focusing on
the center of an object [3, 10, 27, 31]. They assume that
an anchor (i.e., an anchor-point for an anchor-free detector,
or an anchor-box for an anchor-based detector) at the cen-
ter of the object is likely to give more accurate predictions
for both classification and localization. For example, re-
cent FCOS [27] and ATSS [31] both use a centerness branch
arXiv:2108.07755v3 [cs.CV] 28 Aug 2021

to enhance classification scores predicted from the anchors
near the center of the object, and assign larger weights to
the localization loss for the corresponding anchors. Besides,
FoveaBox [10] regards the anchors inside a predefined cen-
tral region of the object as positive samples. Such heuristic
designs have achieved excellent results, but these methods
might suffer from two limitations:
(1) Independence of classification and localization. Re-
cent one-stage detectors perform object classification and
localization independently by using two separate branches
in parallel ( i.e., heads). Such a two-branch design might
cause a lack of interaction between the two tasks, leading to
an inconsistency in predictions when performing them. As
shown in the ‘Result’ column in Figure 1, an ATSS detector
recognizes an object of ‘Dining table’ (indicated by the an-
chor shown with a red patch), but localizes another object
of ‘Pizza’ more accurately (red bounding box).
(2) Task-agnostic sample assignment. Most anchor-free
detectors use a geometry-based assignment scheme to se-
lect anchor-points near the center of an object for both clas-
sification and localization [3, 10, 31], while anchor-based
detectors often assign anchor-boxes by computing IoUs be-
tween the anchor boxes and ground truth [22, 23, 31]. How-
ever, the optimal anchors for classification and localization
are often inconsistent, and may vary considerably depend-
ing on the shape and characteristics of the objects. The
widely used sample assignment scheme is task agnostic,
and thus may be difficult to make an accurate yet consis-
tent prediction for the two tasks, as demonstrated in ‘Score’
and ‘IoU’ distributions of ATSS in Figure 1. The ‘Result’
column also illustrates that a spatial location of the best lo-
calization anchor (green patch) can be not at the center of
the object, and it is not well aligned with the best classifi-
cation anchor (red patch). As a result, a precise bounding
box may be suppressed by the less accurate one during Non-
Maximum Suppression (NMS).
To address such limitations, we propose a Task-aligned
One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that aims to align the
two tasks more accurately by designing a new head struc-
ture with an alignment-oriented learning approach:
Task-aligned head. In contrast to the conventional head
in one-stage object detection where classification and local-
ization are implemented separately by using two branches
in parallel, we design a Task-aligned head (T-head) to en-
hance an interaction between the two tasks. This allows the
two tasks to work more collaboratively, which in turn aligns
their predictions more accurately. T-head is conceptually
simple: it computes task-interactive features, and makes
predictions via a novel Task-Aligned Predictor (TAP). Then
it aligns spatial distributions of the two predictions accord-
ing to the learning signals provided by a task alignment
learning, as described next.
Task alignment learning. To further overcome the mis-
alignment problem, we propose a Task Alignment Learning
(TAL) to explicitly pull closer the optimal anchors for the
two tasks. It is performed by designing a sample assign-
ment scheme and a task-aligned loss. The sample assign-
ment collects training samples ( i.e., positives or negatives)
by computing a degree of task-alignment at each anchor,
whereas the task-aligned loss gradually unifies the best an-
chors for predicting both classification and localization dur-
ing the training. Therefore, at inference, a bounding box
with the highest classification score and jointly having the
most precise localization can be preserved.
The proposed T-head and learning strategy can work col-
laboratively towards making predictions with high quality
in both classification and localization. The main contribu-
tions of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) we de-
sign a new T-head to enhance the interaction between clas-
sification and localization while maintaining their charac-
teristics, and further align the two tasks at the predictions;
(2) we propose TAL to explicitly align the two tasks at the
identified task-aligned anchors, as well as providing learn-
ing signals for the proposed predictor; (3) we conducted ex-
tensive experiments on MSCOCO [17], where our TOOD
achieved a 51.1 AP, surpassing recent one-stage detectors
such as ATSS [31], GFL [14] and PAA [9], by a large mar-
gin. Qualitative results further validate the effectiveness of
our task-alignment approaches.
2. Related Work
One-stage detectors. OverFeat [25] is one of the earli-
est CNN-based one-stage detectors. Afterward, YOLO [22]
was developed to directly predict bounding boxes and clas-
sification scores, without an additional stage to generate re-
gion proposals. SSD [18] introduces anchors with multi-
scale predictions from multi-layer convolutional features,
and Focal loss [16] was proposed to address the problem
of class imbalance for one-stage detectors like RetinaNet.
Keypoint-based detection methods, such as [3, 11, 34],
address the detection problem by identifying and group-
ing multiple key points of a bounding box. Recently,
FCOS [27] and FoveaBox [10] were developed to locate
objects of interest via anchor-points and point-to-boundary
distances. Most mainstream one-stage detectors are com-
posed of two FCN-based branches for classification and lo-
calization, which may lead to the misalignment between the
two tasks. In this paper, we enhance the alignment between
the two tasks via a new head structure and an alignment-
oriented learning approach.
Training sample assignment. Most anchor-based detec-
tors such as [22, 31], collect training samples by computing
IoUs between proposals and ground truth, while an anchor-
free detector regards the anchors inside the center region
of an object as positive samples [3, 10, 27]. Recent stud-

Figure 2. Overall learning mechanism of TOOD. First, predictions
are made by T-head on the FPN features. Second, the predictions
are used to compute a task alignment metric at each anchor point,
based on which TAL produces learning signals for T-head . Lastly,
T-head adjusts the distributions of classification and localization
accordingly. Specifically, the most aligned anchor obtains a higher
classification score through ‘prob’ (probability map), and acquires
a more accurate bounding box prediction via a learned ‘offset’.
ies attempted to train the detectors more effectively by col-
lecting more informative training samples using output re-
sults. For example, FSAF [36] selects meaningful samples
from feature pyramids based on the computed loss, and sim-
ilarly, SAPD [35] provides a soft-selection version of FSAF
by designing a meta-selection network. FreeAnchor [32]
and MAL [8] identify the best anchor-box by computing
the losses in an effort to improve the matching between an-
chors and objects. PAA [9] adaptively separates the anchors
into positive and negative samples by fitting a probability
distribution to the anchor scores. Mutual Guidance [29] im-
proves anchor assignment for one task by considering the
prediction quality on the other task. Different from the pos-
itive/negative sample assignment, PISA [1] re-weights the
training samples according to the precision rank of the out-
puts. Noisy Anchor [12] assigns soft labels to the training
samples, and re-weights the anchor-boxes using a cleanli-
ness score to mitigate the noise incurred by binary labels.
GFL [14] replaces the binary classification label with an
IoU score to integrate the localization quality into classi-
fication. These excellent approaches inspired the current
work to develop a new assignment mechanism from a task-
alignment point of view.
3. Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection
Overview. Similar to recent one-stage detectors such
as [14, 31], the proposed TOOD has an overall pipeline
of ‘backbone-FPN-head’. Moreover, by considering effi-
ciency and simplicity, TOOD uses a single anchor per lo-
cation (same as ATSS [31]), where the ‘anchor’ means an
anchor point for an anchor-free detector, or an anchor box
for an anchor-based detector. As discussed, existing one-
stage detectors have limitations of task misalignment be-
tween classification and localization, due to the divergence
of two tasks which are often implemented using two sep-
arate head branches. In this work, we propose to align
the two tasks more explicitly using a designed Task-aligned
head (T-head) with a new Task Alignment Learning (TAL).
As illustrated in Figure 2, T-head and TAL can work col-
laboratively to improve the alignment of two tasks. Specif-
ically, T-head first makes predictions for the classification
and localization on the FPN features. Then TAL computes
task alignment signals based on a new task alignment met-
ric which measures the degree of alignment between the two
predictions. Lastly, T-head automatically adjusts its classifi-
cation probabilities and localization predictions using learn-
ing signals computed from TAL during back propagation.
3.1. Task-aligned Head
Our goal is to design an efficient head structure to im-
prove the conventional design of the head in one-stage de-
tectors (as shown in Figure 3(a)). In this work, we achieve
this by considering two aspects: (1) increasing the interac-
tion between the two tasks, and (2) enhancing the detector
ability of learning the alignment. The proposed T-head is
shown in Figure 3(b), where it has a simple feature extrac-
tor with two Task-Aligned Predictors (TAP).
To enhance the interaction between classification and lo-
calization, we use a feature extractor to learn a stack oftask-
interactive features from multiple convolutional layers, as
shown by the blue part in Figure 3(b). This design not only
facilitates the task interaction, but also provides multi-level
features with multi-scale effective receptive fields for the
two tasks. Formally, let Xfpn ∈ RH×W ×C denotes the
FPN features, where H, W and C indicate height, width
and the number of channels, respectively. The feature ex-
tractor usesN consecutive conv layers with activation func-
tions to compute the task-interactive features:
Xinter
k =
{
δ(convk(Xfpn)),k = 1
δ(convk(Xinter
k−1 )),k> 1,∀k∈{ 1,2,...,N}, (1)
whereconvk andδ refer to the k-th conv layer and a relu
function, respectively. Thus we extract rich multi-scale fea-
tures from the FPN features using a single branch in the
head. Then, the computed task-interactive features will be
fed into two TAP for aligning classification and localization.
Task-aligned Predictor (TAP). We perform both ob-
ject classification and localization on the computed task-
interactive features, where the two tasks can well perceive
the state of each other. However, due to the single branch

design, the task-interactive features inevitably introduce a
certain level of feature conflicts between two different tasks,
which have also been discussed in [26, 28]. Intuitively, the
tasks of object classification and localization have different
targets, and thus focus on different types of features ( e.g.,
different levels or receptive fields). Consequently, we pro-
pose a layer attention mechanism to encourage task decom-
position by dynamically computing such task-specific fea-
tures at the layer level. As shown in Figure 3(c), the task-
specific features are computed separately for each task of
classification or localization:
Xtask
k = wk·Xinter
k ,∀k∈{ 1, 2,...,N}, (2)
where wk is the k-th element of the learned layer atten-
tion w∈ RN . w is computed from the cross-layer task-
interactive features, and is able to capture the dependencies
between layers:
w =σ(fc 2(δ(fc 1(xinter)))), (3)
where fc 1 and fc 2 refer to two fully-connected layers. σ
is a sigmoid function, and xinter is obtained by applying
an average pooling to Xinter which are the concatenated
features of Xinter
k . Finally, the results of classification or
localization are predicted from eachXtask:
Ztask =conv2(δ(conv1(Xtask))), (4)
where Xtask is the concatenated features of Xtask
k , and
conv1 is a 1×1 conv layer for dimension reduction. Ztask
is then converted into dense classification scores P ∈
RH×W ×80 using sigmoid function, or object bounding
boxes B ∈ RH×W ×4 with distance-to-bbox conversion
as applied in [27, 31].
Prediction alignment. At the prediction step, we further
align the two tasks explicitly by adjusting the spatial dis-
tributions of the two predictions: P andB. Different from
the previous works using a centerness branch [27] or an IoU
branch [9] which can only adjust the classification predic-
tion based on either classification features or localization
features, we align the two predictions by considering both
tasks jointly using the computed task-interactive features.
Notably, we perform the alignment method separately on
the two tasks. As shown in Figure 3(c), we use a spatial
probability mapM∈ RH×W ×1 to adjust the classification
prediction:
Palign =
√
P×M, (5)
whereM is computed from the interactive features, allow-
ing it to learn a degree of consistency between the two tasks
at each spatial location.
Meanwhile, to make an alignment on localization pre-
diction, we further learn spatial offset mapsO∈ RH×W ×8
from the interactive features, which are used to adjust the
predicted bounding box at each location. Specifically, the
learned spatial offset enables the most aligned anchor point
to identify the best boundary predictions around it:
Balign(i,j,c) =B(i+O(i,j,2×c),j +O(i,j,2×c+ 1),c), (6)
where an index (i,j,c ) denotes the (i,j )-th spatial location
at thec-th channel in a tensor. Eq.(6) is implemented by bi-
linear interpolation, and its computational overhead is neg-
ligible due to the very small channel dimension ofB. Note-
worthily, offsets are learned independently for each chan-
nel, which means each boundary of the object has its own
learned offset. This allows for a more accurate prediction of
the four boundaries because each of them can individually
learn from the most precise anchor point near it. Therefore,
our method not only aligns the two tasks, but also improves
the localization accuracy by identifying a precise anchor
point for each side.
The alignment mapsM andO are learned automatically
from the stack of interactive features:
M =σ(conv2(δ(conv1(Xinter)))) (7)
O =conv4(δ(conv3(Xinter))) (8)
whereconv1 andconv3 are two 1×1 conv layers for dimen-
sion reduction. The learning of M andO is performed by
using the proposed Task Alignment Learning (TAL) which

will be described next. Notice that our T-head is an inde-
pendent module and can work well without TAL. It can be
readily applied to various one-stage object detectors in a
plug-and-play manner to improve detection performance.
3.2. Task Alignment Learning
We further introduce a Task Alignment Learning (TAL)
that further guides our T-head to make task-aligned predic-
tions. TAL differs from previous methods [1, 8, 9, 12, 14,
29, 32] in two aspects. First, from the task-alignment point
of view, it dynamically selects high-quality anchors based
on a designed metric. Second, it considers both anchor
assignment and weighting simultaneously. It comprises a
sample assignment strategy and new losses designed specif-
ically for aligning the two tasks.
3.2.1 Task-aligned Sample Assignment
To cope with NMS, the anchor assignment for a training in-
stance should satisfy the following rules: (1) a well-aligned
anchor should be able to predict a high classification score
with a precise localization jointly; (2) a misaligned anchor
should have a low classification score and be suppressed
subsequently. With the two objectives, we design a new an-
chor alignment metric to explicitly measure the degree of
task-alignment at the anchor level. The alignment metric is
integrated into the sample assignment and loss functions to
dynamically refine the predictions at each anchor.
Anchor alignment metric. Considering that a classifica-
tion score and an IoU between the predicted bounding box
and the ground truth indicate the quality of the predictions
by the two tasks, we measure the degree of task-alignment
using a high-order combination of the classification score
and the IoU. To be specific, we design the following metric
to compute anchor-level alignment for each instance:
t =sα×uβ, (9)
where s and u denote a classification score and an IoU
value, respectively. α andβ are used to control the impact
of the two tasks in the anchor alignment metric. Notably,
t plays a critical role in the joint optimization of the two
tasks towards the goal of task-alignment. It encourages the
networks to dynamically focus on high-quality ( i.e., task-
aligned) anchors from the perspective of joint optimization.
Training sample assignment. As discussed in [31, 32],
training sample assignment is crucial to the training of ob-
ject detectors. To improve the alignment of two tasks, we
focus on the task-aligned anchors, and adopt a simple as-
signment rule to select the training samples: for each in-
stance, we select m anchors having the largest t values as
positive samples, while using the remaining anchors as neg-
ative ones. Again, the training is performed by comput-
ing new loss functions designed specifically for aligning the
tasks of classification and localization.
3.2.2 Task-aligned Loss
Classification objective. To explicitly increase classifica-
tion scores for the aligned anchors, and at the same time, re-
duce the scores of the misaligned ones ( i.e., having a small
t), we use t to replace the binary label of a positive anchor
during training. However, we found that the network can-
not converge when the labels (i.e.,t) of the positive anchors
become small with the increase of α andβ. Therefore, we
use a normalized t, namely ˆt, to replace the binary label of
the positive anchor, where ˆt is normalized by the follow-
ing two properties: (1) to ensure effective learning of hard
instances (which usually have a small t for all correspond-
ing positive anchors); (2) to preserve the rank between in-
stances based on the precision of the predicted bounding
boxes. Thus, we adopt a simple instance-level normaliza-
tion to adjust the scale ofˆt: the maximum of ˆt is equal to the
largest IoU value (u) within each instance. Then Binary
CrossEntropy (BCE ) computed on the positive anchors
for the classification task can be rewritten as,
Lclspos =
Npos∑
i=1
BCE (si, ˆti), (10)
wherei denotes thei-th anchor from the Npos positive an-
chors corresponding to one instance. Following [16], we
employ a focal loss for classification to mitigate the im-
balance between the negative and positive samples during
training. The focal loss computed on the positive anchors
can be reformulated by Eq.(10), and the final loss function
for the classification task is defined as follows:
Lcls=
Npos∑
i=1
⏐⏐ˆti−si
⏐⏐γBCE(si,ˆti) +
Nneg∑
j=1
sγ
j BCE(sj,0), (11)
where j denotes the j-th anchor from the Nneg negative
anchors, andγ is the focusing parameter [16].
Localization objective. A bounding box predicted by a
well-aligned anchor (i.e., having a larget) usually has both
a large classification score with a precise localization, and
such a bounding box is more likely to be preserved dur-
ing NMS. In addition, t can be applied for selecting high-
quality bounding boxes by weighting the loss more care-
fully to improve the training. As discussed in [21], learn-
ing from high-quality bounding boxes is beneficial to the
performance of a model, while the low-quality ones often
have a negative impact on the training by producing a large
amount of less informative and redundant signals to update
the model. In our case, we apply the t value for measuring
the quality of a bounding box. Thus, we improve the task
alignment and regression precision by focusing on the well-
aligned anchors (with a large t), while reducing the impact
of the misaligned anchors (with a small t) during bounding

whereb and ̄b denote the predicted bounding boxes and the

4. Experiments and Results
Dataset and evaluation protocol. All experiments are
implemented on the large-scale detection benchmark MS-
COCO 2017 [17]. Following the standard practice [15, 16],
we use the trainval135k set (115K images) for training
andminival set (5K images) as validation for our ablation
study. We report our main results on the test-dev set for
comparison with the state-of-the-art detectors. The perfor-
mance is measured by COCO Average Precision (AP) [17].
Implementation details. As with most one-stage de-
tectors [10, 16, 27], we use the detection pipeline of
‘backbone-FPN-head’, with different backbones includ-
ing ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101-64×4d pre-
trained on ImageNet [2]. Similar to ATSS [31], TOOD tiles
one anchor per location. Unless specified, we report exper-
imental results of an anchor-free TOOD (an anchor-based
TOOD can achieve a similar performance as shown in Ta-
ble 3). The number of interactive layers N is set as 6 to
make T-head have a similar number of parameters as the
conventional parallel head, and the focusing parameterγ is
set to 2 as used in [14, 16]. More implementation and train-
ing details are presented in Supplementary Material (SM).
4.1. Ablation Study
For an ablation study, we use the ResNet-50 backbone
and train the model for 12 epochs unless specified. The
performances are reported on COCOminival set.

On head structures. We compare our T-head with the
conventional parallel head in Table 1. It can be adopted
in various one-stage detectors in a plug-and-play manner,
and consistently outperforms the conventional head by 0.7
to 1.9 AP, with fewer parameters and FLOPs. This vali-
dates the effectiveness of our design, and demonstrates that
T-head can work more efficiently with higher performance,
by introducing task interaction and prediction alignment.
On sample assignments. To demonstrate the effective-
ness of TAL, we compare TAL with other learning meth-
ods using different sample assignment methods, as shown
in Table 2. Training sample assignment can be divided into
the fixed assignment and adaptive assignment according to
whether it is a learning-based method. Different from the
existing assignment methods, TAL adaptively assigns both
positive and negative anchors, and at the same time, com-
putes the weights of positive anchors more carefully, result-
ing in higher performance. To compare with PAA (+IoU
pred.) which has an additional prediction structure, we inte-

grate TAP into TAL, resulting in a higher AP of 42.5. More
discussions on the differences between TAL and previous
methods are presented in SM.
TOOD. We evaluate the performance of the complete
TOOD (T-head + TAL). As shown in Table 3, the anchor-
free TOOD and anchor-based TOOD can achieve similar
performance, i.e., 42.5 AP and 42.4 AP. Compared with
ATSS, TOOD improves the performance of ∼3.2 AP. To
be more specific, the improvements on AP 75 are signifi-
cant, which yields ∼3.8 points higher AP in TOOD. This
validates that aligning the two tasks can improve the de-
tection performance. Notably, TOOD brings a higher im-
provement (+3.3 AP) than the sum of the individual im-
provements by T-head + ATSS (+1.9 AP) and Parallel head
+ TAL (+1.1 AP), as shown in Table 6. It suggests that T-
head and TAL can compensate strongly to each other.
On hyper-parameters. We first investigate the perfor-
mance using different values of α and β for TAL, which
control the influence of classification confidence and local-
ization precision on anchor alignment metric viat. Through
a coarse search shown in Table 4, we adopt α = 1 and
β = 6 for our TAL. We then conduct several experiments
to study the robustness of the hyper-parameter m, which is
used to select positive anchors. We use different values of
m in [5, 9, 13, 17, 21], and achieve results in a range of
42.0∼42.5 AP, which suggests the performance is insensi-
tive tom. Thus, we adoptm = 13 in all our experiments.
4.2. Comparison with the State-of-the-Art
We compare our TOOD with other one-stage detectors
on the COCO test-dev in Table 5. The models are trained
with scale jitter (480-800) and for 2× learning schedule (24

epochs) as the most current method [14]. For a fair com-
parison, we report results of single model and single test-
ing scale. With ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101-64 ×4d,
TOOD achieves 46.7 AP and 48.3 AP, outperforming the
most current one-stage detectors such as ATSS [31] (by∼3
AP) and GFL [14] (by∼2 AP). Furthermore, with ResNet-
101-DCN and ResNeXt-101-64×4d-DCN, TOOD brings a
larger improvement, comparing to other detectors. For ex-
ample, it obtains an improvement of 2.8 AP (48.3 →51.1
AP) while ATSS has a 2.1 AP (45.6 →47.7 AP) improve-
ment. This validates that TOOD can cooperate with De-
formable Convolutional Networks (DCN) [37] more effi-
ciently, by adaptively adjusting the spatial distribution of
the learned features for task-alignment. Note that in TOOD,
DCN is applied to the first two layers in the head tower. As
shown in Table 5, TOOD achieves a new state-of-the-art re-
sult with 51.1 AP in one-stage object detection.

4.3. Quantitative Analysis for Task-alignment
We quantitatively analyze the effect of the proposed
methods on the alignment of two tasks. Without NMS, we
calculate a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between
the rankings [20] of classification and localization by se-
lecting top-50 confident predictions for each instance, and
a mean IoU of the top-10 confident predictions, averaged
over instances. As shown in Table 6, the mean PCC and
IoU are improved by using T-head and TAL. Meanwhile,
with NMS, the number of the correct boxes (IoU>=0.5) in-
creases while those of the redundant (IoU>=0.5) and error
boxes (0.1<IoU<0.5) decrease substantially when applying
T-head and TAL. The statistics suggest that TOOD is more
compatible with NMS, by preserving more correct boxes,
and suppressing the redundant/error boxes significantly. At
last, detection performance is improved by 3.3 AP in total.
Several detection examples are illustrated in Figure 4.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we illustrate the misalignment between
classification and localization in the existing one-stage de-
tectors, and propose TOOD to align the two tasks. In par-
ticular, we design a task-aligned head to enhance the inter-
action of two tasks, and then improve its ability of learning
the alignment. Furthermore, a new task-aligned learning
strategy is developed by introducing a sample assignment
scheme and new loss functions, both of which are computed
via an anchor alignment metric. With these improvements,
TOOD achieved a 51.1 AP on MS-COCO, surpassing the

TOOD: Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection
1. Implementation details
In this section, we describe the processes of network op-
timization and inference in more detail.
Optimization. Our implementations are based on the
MMDetection toolbox [2] and Pytorch [7]. The models
with backbone ResNet-50 are trained with 4 GPUs and a
mini-batch of 4 per GPU, while the others are trained with 8
GPUs and a mini-batch of 2 per GPU. We use the Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a weight decay of
0.0001 and a momentum of 0.9. Unless specific, the mod-
els are trained for 12 epochs (1× learning schedule) and the
initial learning rate is set to 0.01 and then reduced by a fac-
tor of 10 at the 8-th epoch and the 11-th epoch. The input
images are resized to have a shorter side of 800 while the
longer side is kept less than 1333. Specifically, if an anchor
is assigned to the positive samples of more than one object,
we only assign this anchor to the object with the minimal
area. For the experiments compared with the state-of-the-
art detectors, we train the models with scale jitter and for
24 epochs (2× learning schedule) as [6].
Inference. The inference phase is the same as that of
ATSS [9]. Namely, we resize the input image in the same
way as the training phase (i.e., the shorter side is resized to
800 while the longer side is kept less than 1333), and then
forward it through the detection network to obtain the pre-
dicted bounding boxes with a predicted class. Afterward,
we use a confidence threshold of 0.05 to filter out the predic-
tions with low confidence, and then select the top 1000 scor-
ing boxes from each feature pyramid. Finally, we adopt the
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) with the IoU threshold
of 0.6 per class to generate the final top 100 confident pre-
dictions per image.
2. Discussion
Differences between TAL and previous works. As dis-
cussed, the proposed TAL is a learning-based approach for
anchor selection and weighting. Here we discuss the dif-
ferences between our TAL and several recent methods in
terms of anchor selection and weighting. As mentioned in
the paper, the adaptive methods can be divided into two
categories: (1) positive/negative anchor collection such as
FreeAnchor [10], MAL [3], PAA [4] and Mutual Guid-
ance [8]; (2) anchor weighting such as PISA [1], NoisyAn-
chor [5] and GFL [6] ( e.g., by modifying the loss func-
tions). These methods adaptively perform either anchor col-
lection or anchor weighting. We propose TAL that consid-
ers both aspects at the same time, allowing it to measure in-
formative or high-quality anchors more accurately. Specif-
ically, TAL is designed to dynamically collect the posi-
tive/negative anchors from a task-alignment point of view,
and further weight the positive anchors carefully, according
to the degree of task-alignment at each location. Compared
with the current assignment methods such as ATSS [6] and
PAA [4] which first select a set of candidate anchors based
on the IoU score, and then analyze the distribution charac-
teristics of the anchors to assign samples, the design of TAL
is simpler yet more efficient by directly assigning the sam-
ples based on the proposed alignment metric. Particularly,
recent Mutual Guidance [8] tackles the task-misalignment
problem by assigning positive/negative anchors for one task
according to the predefined anchors and the prediction qual-
ity on the other task. Different from Mutual Guidance, TAL
assigns positive/negative anchors for each task based on the
alignment between both two tasks, and is completely in-
dependent of the predefined anchors. Besides, GFL [6]
attempted to align the tasks by replacing a binary classi-
fication label with an IoU score, on the basis of ATSS.
TAL is different from the GFL, by using the proposed task-
alignment metric to design both sample assignment and an-
chor weighting, which allows it to explicitly learn to refine
both classification and localization in a coordinated fashion.
