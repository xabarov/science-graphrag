## Abstract

We propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detec-
tor (FCOS) to solve object detection in a per-pixel predic-
tion fashion, analogue to semantic segmentation. Almost
all state-of-the-art object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD,
YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on pre-defined anchor
boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor
box free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-
defined set of anchor boxes, FCOS completely avoids the
complicated computation related to anchor boxes such as
calculating overlapping during training. More importantly,
we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to anchor boxes,
which are often very sensitive to the final detection perfor-
mance. With the only post-processing non-maximum sup-
pression (NMS), FCOS with ResNeXt-64x4d-101 achieves
44.7% in AP with single-model and single-scale testing,
surpassing previous one-stage detectors with the advantage
of being much simpler . F or the first time, we demonstrate
a much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving
improved detection accuracy. We hope that the proposed
FCOS framework can serve as a simple and strong alterna-
tive for many other instance-level tasks. Code is available

1. Introduction
Object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in
computer vision, which requires the algorithm to predict a
bounding box with a category label for each instance of in-
terest in an image. All current mainstream detectors such
as Faster R-CNN [24], SSD [18] and YOLOv2, v3 [23] rely
on a set of pre-defined anchor boxes and it has long been
believed that the use of anchor boxes is the key to detectors’
success. Despite their great success, it is important to note
that anchor-based detectors suffer some drawbacks: 1) As
shown in [15, 24], detection performance is sensitive to the
sizes, aspect ratios and number of anchor boxes. For exam-
ple, in RetinaNet [15], varying these hyper-parameters af-
fects the performance up to 4% in AP on the COCO bench-
mark [16]. As a result, these hyper-parameters need to be

Figure 1 – As shown in the left image, FCOS works by predicting a
4D vector (l, t, r, b) encoding the location of a bounding box at each
foreground pixel (supervised by ground-truth bounding box information
during training). The right plot shows that when a location residing in
multiple bounding boxes, it can be ambiguous in terms of which bound-
ing box this location should regress.
carefully tuned in anchor-based detectors. 2) Even with
careful design, because the scales and aspect ratios of an-
chor boxes are kept fixed, detectors encounter difficulties to
deal with object candidates with large shape variations, par-
ticularly for small objects. The pre-defined anchor boxes
also hamper the generalization ability of detectors, as they
need to be re-designed on new detection tasks with differ-
ent object sizes or aspect ratios. 3) In order to achieve
a high recall rate, an anchor-based detector is required to
densely place anchor boxes on the input image ( e.g., more
than 180K anchor boxes in feature pyramid networks (FPN)
[14] for an image with its shorter side being 800). Most
of these anchor boxes are labelled as negative samples dur-
ing training. The excessive number of negative samples ag-
gravates the imbalance between positive and negative sam-
ples in training. 4) Anchor boxes also involve complicated
computation such as calculating the intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores with ground-truth bounding boxes.
Recently, fully convolutional networks (FCNs) [20] have
achieved tremendous success in dense prediction tasks such
as semantic segmentation [20, 28, 9, 19], depth estimation
[17, 31], keypoint detection [3] and counting [2]. As one
of high-level vision tasks, object detection might be the
only one deviating from the neat fully convolutional per-
9627

pixel prediction framework mainly due to the use of anchor
boxes. It is nature to ask a question: Can we solve object
detection in the neat per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue
to FCN for semantic segmentation, for example? Thus
those fundamental vision tasks can be unified in (almost)
one single framework. We show that the answer is affir-
mative. Moreover, we demonstrate that, for the first time,
the much simpler FCN-based detector achieves even better
performance than its anchor-based counterparts.
In the literature, some works attempted to leverage the
FCNs-based framework for object detection such as Dense-
Box [12]. Specifically, these FCN-based frameworks di-
rectly predict a 4D vector plus a class category at each spa-
tial location on a level of feature maps. As shown in Fig. 1
(left), the 4D vector depicts the relative offsets from the four
sides of a bounding box to the location. These frameworks
are similar to the FCNs for semantic segmentation, except
that each location is required to regress a 4D continuous
vector. However, to handle the bounding boxes with dif-
ferent sizes, DenseBox [12] crops and resizes training im-
ages to a fixed scale. Thus DenseBox has to perform detec-
tion on image pyramids, which is against FCN’s philosophy
of computing all convolutions once. Besides, more signif-
icantly, these methods are mainly used in special domain
objection detection such as scene text detection [33, 10] or
face detection [32, 12], since it is believed that these meth-
ods do not work well when applied to generic object de-
tection with highly overlapped bounding boxes. As shown
in Fig. 1 (right), the highly overlapped bounding boxes re-
sult in an intractable ambiguity: it is not clear w.r.t. which
bounding box to regress for the pixels in the overlapped re-
gions.
In the sequel, we take a closer look at the issue and show
that with FPN this ambiguity can be largely eliminated. As
a result, our method can already obtain comparable detec-
tion accuracy with those traditional anchor based detectors.
Furthermore, we observe that our method may produce a
number of low-quality predicted bounding boxes at the lo-
cations that are far from the center of an target object. In
order to suppress these low-quality detections, we intro-
duce a novel “center-ness” branch (only one layer) to pre-
dict the deviation of a pixel to the center of its correspond-
ing bounding box, as defined in Eq. (3). This score is then
used to down-weight low-quality detected bounding boxes
and merge the detection results in NMS. The simple yet ef-
fective center-ness branch allows the FCN-based detector
to outperform anchor-based counterparts under exactly the
same training and testing settings.
This new detection framework enjoys the following ad-
vantages.
• Detection is now unified with many other FCN-
solvable tasks such as semantic segmentation, making
it easier to re-use ideas from those tasks.
• Detection becomes proposal free and anchor free,
which significantly reduces the number of design pa-
rameters. The design parameters typically need heuris-
tic tuning and many tricks are involved in order to
achieve good performance. Therefore, our new de-
tection framework makes the detector, particularly its
training, considerably simpler.
• By eliminating the anchor boxes, our new detector
completely avoids the complicated computation re-
lated to anchor boxes such as the IOU computation and
matching between the anchor boxes and ground-truth
boxes during training, resulting in faster training and
testing as well as less training memory footprint than
its anchor-based counterpart.
• Without bells and whistles, we achieve state-of-the-
art results among one-stage detectors. We also show
that the proposed FCOS can be used as a Region
Proposal Networks (RPNs) in two-stage detectors and
can achieve significantly better performance than its
anchor-based RPN counterparts. Given the even better
performance of the much simpler anchor-free detector,
we encourage the community to rethink the necessity of
anchor boxes in object detection , which are currently
considered as the de facto standard for detection.
• The proposed detector can be immediately extended
to solve other vision tasks with minimal modification,
including instance segmentation and key-point detec-
tion. We believe that this new method can be the new
baseline for many instance-wise prediction problems.
2. Related Work
Anchor-based Detectors. Anchor-based detectors in-
herit the ideas from traditional sliding-window and proposal
based detectors such as Fast R-CNN [6]. In anchor-based
detectors, the anchor boxes can be viewed as pre-defined
sliding windows or proposals, which are classified as pos-
itive or negative patches, with an extra offsets regression
to refine the prediction of bounding box locations. There-
fore, the anchor boxes in these detectors may be viewed
as training samples . Unlike previous detectors like Fast
RCNN, which compute image features for each sliding win-
dow/proposal repeatedly, anchor boxes make use of the fea-
ture maps of CNNs and avoid repeated feature computation,
speeding up detection process dramatically. The design of
anchor boxes are popularized by Faster R-CNN in its RPNs
[24], SSD [18] and YOLOv2 [22], and has become the con-
vention in a modern detector.
However, as described above, anchor boxes result in
excessively many hyper-parameters, which typically need
to be carefully tuned in order to achieve good perfor-
mance. Besides the above hyper-parameters describing an-
chor shapes, the anchor-based detectors also need other

hyper-parameters to label each anchor box as a positive,
ignored or negative sample. In previous works, they of-
ten employ intersection over union (IOU) between anchor
boxes and ground-truth boxes to determine the label of an
anchor box ( e.g., a positive anchor if its IOU is in [0.5, 1]).
These hyper-parameters have shown a great impact on the
final accuracy, and require heuristic tuning. Meanwhile,
these hyper-parameters are specific to detection tasks, mak-
ing detection tasks deviate from a neat fully convolutional
network architectures used in other dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation.
Anchor-free Detectors. The most popular anchor-free
detector might be YOLOv1 [21]. Instead of using anchor
boxes, YOLOv1 predicts bounding boxes at points near
the center of objects. Only the points near the center are
used since they are considered to be able to produce higher-
quality detection. However, since only points near the cen-
ter are used to predict bounding boxes, YOLOv1 suffers
from low recall as mentioned in YOLOv2 [22]. As a result,
YOLOv2 [22] employs anchor boxes as well. Compared to
YOLOv1, FCOS takes advantages of all points in a ground
truth bounding box to predict the bounding boxes and the
low-quality detected bounding boxes are suppressed by the
proposed “center-ness” branch. As a result, FCOS is able to
provide comparable recall with anchor-based detectors as
shown in our experiments.
CornerNet [13] is a recently proposed one-stage anchor-
free detector, which detects a pair of corners of a bound-
ing box and groups them to form the final detected bound-
ing box. CornerNet requires much more complicated post-
processing to group the pairs of corners belonging to the
same instance. An extra distance metric is learned for the
purpose of grouping.
Another family of anchor-free detectors such as [32] are
based on DenseBox [12]. The family of detectors have been
considered unsuitable for generic object detection due to
difficulty in handling overlapping bounding boxes and the
recall being relatively low. In this work, we show that both
problems can be largely alleviated with multi-level FPN
prediction. Moreover, we also show together with our pro-
posed center-ness branch, the much simpler detector can
achieve even better detection performance than its anchor-
based counterparts.
3. Our Approach
In this section, we first reformulate object detection in
a per-pixel prediction fashion. Next, we show that how
we make use of multi-level prediction to improve the re-
call and resolve the ambiguity resulted from overlapped
bounding boxes. Finally, we present our proposed “center-
ness” branch, which helps suppress the low-quality detected
bounding boxes and improves the overall performance by a
large margin.
3.1. Fully Convolutional One­Stage Object Detector
Let Fi ∈ RH×W ×C be the feature maps at layer i of
a backbone CNN and s be the total stride until the layer.
The ground-truth bounding boxes for an input image are
defined as {Bi}, where Bi = ( x(i)
0 , y(i)
0 , x(i)
1 y(i)
1 , c(i)) ∈
R4 × { 1, 2 ... C }. Here (x(i)
0 , y(i)
0 ) and (x(i)
1 y(i)
1 ) denote
the coordinates of the left-top and right-bottom corners of
the bounding box. c(i) is the class that the object in the
bounding box belongs to. C is the number of classes, which
is 80 for MS-COCO dataset.
For each location (x, y) on the feature map Fi, we can
9629

map it back onto the input image as (⌊ s
2 ⌋ + xs,
⌊ s
2
⌋
+ ys),
which is near the center of the receptive field of the location
(x, y). Different from anchor-based detectors, which con-
sider the location on the input image as the center of (multi-
ple) anchor boxes and regress the target bounding box with
these anchor boxes as references, we directly regress the tar-
get bounding box at the location. In other words, our detec-
tor directly views locations as training samples instead of
anchor boxes in anchor-based detectors, which is the same
as FCNs for semantic segmentation [20].
Specifically, location (x, y) is considered as a positive
sample if it falls into any ground-truth box and the class la-
bel c∗ of the location is the class label of the ground-truth
box. Otherwise it is a negative sample and c∗ = 0 (back-
ground class). Besides the label for classification, we also
have a 4D real vector ttt∗ = ( l∗, t∗, r∗, b∗) being the regres-
sion targets for the location. Here l∗, t∗, r∗ and b∗ are the
distances from the location to the four sides of the bound-
ing box, as shown in Fig. 1 (left). If a location falls into
multiple bounding boxes, it is considered as an ambiguous
sample. We simply choose the bounding box with minimal
area as its regression target. In the next section, we will
show that with multi-level prediction, the number of am-
biguous samples can be reduced significantly and thus they
hardly affect the detection performance. Formally, if loca-
tion (x, y) is associated to a bounding box Bi, the training
regression targets for the location can be formulated as,
l∗ = x − x(i)
0 , t ∗ = y − y(i)
0 ,
r∗ = x(i)
1 − x, b ∗ = y(i)
1 − y.
(1)
It is worth noting that FCOS can leverage as many fore-
ground samples as possible to train the regressor . It is dif-
ferent from anchor-based detectors, which only consider the
anchor boxes with a highly enough IOU with ground-truth
boxes as positive samples. We argue that it may be one of
the reasons that FCOS outperforms its anchor-based coun-
terparts.
Network Outputs. Corresponding to the training tar-
gets, the final layer of our networks predicts an 80D vector ppp
of classification labels and a 4D vector ttt = (l, t, r, b) bound-
ing box coordinates. Following [15], instead of training a
multi-class classifier, we train C binary classifiers. Simi-
lar to [15], we add four convolutional layers after the fea-
ture maps of the backbone networks respectively for clas-
sification and regression branches. Moreover, since the re-
gression targets are always positive, we employ exp(x) to
map any real number to (0, ∞ ) on the top of the regression
branch. It is worth noting that FCOS has 9× fewer network
output variables than the popular anchor-based detectors
[15, 24] with 9 anchor boxes per location.
Loss Function. We define our training loss function as
follows:
L({pppx,y}, {tttx,y}) = 1
Npos
∑
x,y
Lcls(pppx,y, c∗
x,y)
+ λ
Npos
∑
x,y
✶ {c∗
x,y>0}Lreg(tttx,y, ttt∗
x,y),
(2)
where Lcls is focal loss as in [15] and Lreg is the IOU loss
as in UnitBox [32]. Npos denotes the number of positive
samples and λ being 1 in this paper is the balance weight
for Lreg. The summation is calculated over all locations
on the feature maps Fi. ✶ {c∗
i >0} is the indicator function,
being 1 if c∗
i > 0 and 0 otherwise.
Inference. The inference of FCOS is straightforward.
Given an input images, we forward it through the network
and obtain the classification scores pppx,y and the regression
prediction tttx,y for each location on the feature maps Fi.
Following [15], we choose the location with px,y > 0.05 as
positive samples and invert Eq. (1) to obtain the predicted
bounding boxes.
3.2. Multi­level Prediction with FPN for FCOS
Here we show that how two possible issues of the pro-
posed FCOS can be resolved with multi-level prediction
with FPN [14]. 1) The large stride ( e.g., 16 × ) of the final
feature maps in a CNN can result in a relatively low best
possible recall (BPR) 1. For anchor based detectors, low re-
call rates due to the large stride can be compensated to some
extent by lowering the required IOU scores for positive an-
chor boxes. For FCOS, at the first glance one may think that
the BPR can be much lower than anchor-based detectors
because it is impossible to recall an object which no loca-
tion on the final feature maps encodes due to a large stride.
Here, we empirically show that even with a large stride,
FCN-based FCOS is still able to produce a good BPR, and
it can even better than the BPR of the anchor-based detec-
tor RetinaNet [15] in the official implementation Detectron
[7] (refer to Table 1). Therefore, the BPR is actually not
a problem of FCOS. Moreover, with multi-level FPN pre-
diction [14], the BPR can be improved further to match the
best BPR the anchor-based RetinaNet can achieve. 2) Over-
laps in ground-truth boxes can cause intractable ambiguity
, i.e., which bounding box should a location in the overlap
regress? This ambiguity results in degraded performance of
FCN-based detectors. In this work, we show that the am-
biguity can be greatly resolved with multi-level prediction,
and the FCN-based detector can obtain on par , sometimes
even better, performance compared with anchor-based ones.
Following FPN [14], we detect different sizes of ob-
jects on different levels of feature maps. Specifically,
we make use of five levels of feature maps defined as
1Upper bound of the recall rate that a detector can achieve.

{P3, P4, P5, P6, P7}. P3, P4 and P5 are produced by the
backbone CNNs’ feature maps C3, C4 and C5 followed by
a 1 × 1 convolutional layer with the top-down connections
in [14], as shown in Fig. 2. P6 and P7 are produced by ap-
plying one convolutional layer with the stride being 2 on P5
and P6, respectively. As a result, the feature levels P3, P4,
P5, P6 and P7 have strides 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128, respec-
tively.
Unlike anchor-based detectors, which assign anchor
boxes with different sizes to different feature levels, we di-
rectly limit the range of bounding box regression for each
level. More specifically, we firstly compute the regression
targets l∗, t∗, r∗ and b∗ for each location on all feature lev-
els. Next, if a location satisfies max(l∗, t∗, r∗, b∗) > m i
or max(l∗, t∗, r∗, b∗) < m i−1, it is set as a negative sam-
ple and is thus not required to regress a bounding box any-
more. Here mi is the maximum distance that feature level
i needs to regress. In this work, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6 and
m7 are set as 0, 64, 128, 256, 512 and ∞ , respectively.
Since objects with different sizes are assigned to different
feature levels and most overlapping happens between ob-
jects with considerably different sizes. If a location, even
with multi-level prediction used, is still assigned to more
than one ground-truth boxes, we simply choose the ground-
truth box with minimal area as its target. As shown in our
experiments, the multi-level prediction can largely alleviate
the aforementioned ambiguity and improve the FCN-based
detector to the same level of anchor-based ones.
Finally, following [14, 15], we share the heads be-
tween different feature levels, not only making the detector
parameter-efficient but also improving the detection perfor-
mance. However, we observe that different feature levels
are required to regress different size range ( e.g., the size
range is [0, 64] for P3 and [64, 128] for P4), and therefore it
is not reasonable to make use of identical heads for differ-
ent feature levels. As a result, instead of using the standard
exp(x), we make use of exp(six) with a trainable scalar si
to automatically adjust the base of the exponential function
for feature level Pi, which slightly improves the detection
performance.
3.3. Center­ness for FCOS
After using multi-level prediction in FCOS, there is still
a performance gap between FCOS and anchor-based detec-
tors. We observed that it is due to a lot of low-quality pre-
dicted bounding boxes produced by locations far away from
the center of an object.
We propose a simple yet effective strategy to suppress
these low-quality detected bounding boxes without intro-
ducing any hyper-parameters. Specifically, we add a single-
layer branch , in parallel with the classification branch (as
shown in Fig. 2) to predict the “center-ness” of a location 2.
2After the initial submission, it has been shown that the AP on MS-
t*
r*l*
b*
Figure 3 – Center-ness. Red, blue, and other
colors denote 1, 0 and the values between them,
respectively. Center-ness is computed by Eq.
(3) and decays from 1 to 0 as the location de-
viates from the center of the object. When test-
ing, the center-ness predicted by the network is
multiplied with the classification score thus can
down-weight the low-quality bounding boxes
predicted by a location far from the center of
an object.
The center-ness depicts the normalized distance from the
location to the center of the object that the location is re-
sponsible for, as shown Fig. 3. Given the regression targets
l∗, t∗, r∗ and b∗ for a location, the center-ness target is de-
fined as,
centerness∗ =
√
min(l∗, r∗)
max(l∗, r∗) × min(t∗, b∗)
max(t∗, b∗) . (3)
We employ sqrt here to slow down the decay of the center-
ness. The center-ness ranges from 0 to 1 and is thus trained
with binary cross entropy (BCE) loss. The loss is added to
the loss function Eq. (2). When testing, the final score (used
for ranking the detected bounding boxes) is computed by
multiplying the predicted center-ness with the correspond-
ing classification score. Thus the center-ness can down-
weight the scores of bounding boxes far from the center
of an object. As a result, with high probability, these low-
quality bounding boxes might be filtered out by the final
non-maximum suppression (NMS) process, improving the
detection performance remarkably.
An alternative of the center-ness is to make use of only
the central portion of ground-truth bounding box as posi-
tive samples with the price of one extra hyper-parameter,
as shown in works [12, 33]. After our submission, it has
been shown in [1] that the combination of both methods
can achieve a much better performance. The experimental
results can be found in Table 3.
4. Experiments
Our experiments are conducted on the large-scale detec-
tion benchmark COCO [16]. Following the common prac-
tice [15, 14, 24], we use the COCO trainval35k split
(115K images) for training and minival split (5K images)
as validation for our ablation study. We report our main re-
sults on the test
dev split (20K images) by uploading our
detection results to the evaluation server.
Training Details. Unless specified, ResNet-50 [8]
is used as our backbone networks and the same hyper-
parameters with RetinaNet [15] are used. Specifically, our
COCO can be improved if the center-ness is parallel with the regression
branch instead of the classification branch. However, unless specified, we
still use the configuration in Fig. 2.

network is trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
for 90K iterations with the initial learning rate being 0.01
and a mini-batch of 16 images. The learning rate is reduced
by a factor of 10 at iteration 60K and 80K, respectively.
Weight decay and momentum are set as 0.0001 and 0.9, re-
spectively. We initialize our backbone networks with the
weights pre-trained on ImageNet [4]. For the newly added
layers, we initialize them as in [15]. Unless specified, the
input images are resized to have their shorter side being 800
and their longer side less or equal to 1333.
Inference Details. We firstly forward the input im-
age through the network and obtain the predicted bounding
boxes with a predicted class. Unless specified, the following
post-processing is exactly the same with RetinaNet [15] and
we directly make use of the same post-processing hyper-
parameters of RetinaNet. We use the same sizes of input
images as in training. We hypothesize that the performance
of our detector may be improved further if we carefully tune
the hyper-parameters.
4.1. Ablation Study
4.1.1 Multi-level Prediction with FPN
As mentioned before, the major concerns of an FCN-based
detector are low recall rates and ambiguous samples re-
sulted from overlapping in ground-truth bounding boxes. In
the section, we show that both issues can be largely resolved
with multi-level prediction.
Best Possible Recalls. The first concern about the FCN-
based detector is that it might not provide a good best pos-
sible recall (BPR). In the section, we show that the con-
cern is not necessary. Here BPR is defined as the ratio of
the number of ground-truth boxes a detector can recall at
the most divided by all ground-truth boxes. A ground-truth
box is considered being recalled if the box is assigned to
at least one sample ( i.e., a location in FCOS or an anchor
box in anchor-based detectors) during training. As shown
in Table 1, only with feature level P4 with stride being 16
(i.e., no FPN), FCOS can already obtain a BPR of 95.55%.
The BPR is much higher than the BPR of 90.92% of the
anchor-based detector RetinaNet in the official implemen-
tation Detectron, where only the low-quality matches with
IOU ≥ 0.4 are used. With the help of FPN, FCOS can
achieve a BPR of 98.40%, which is very close to the best
BPR that the anchor-based detector can achieve by using all
low-quality matches. Due to the fact that the best recall of
current detectors are much lower than 90%, the small BPR
gap (less than 1%) between FCOS and the anchor-based de-
tector will not actually affect the performance of detector.
It is also confirmed in Table 3, where FCOS achieves even
better AR than its anchor-based counterparts under the same
training and testing settings. Therefore, the concern about
low BPR may not be necessary.
Ambiguous Samples. Another concern about the FCN-
based detector is that it may have a large number of ambigu-
ous samples due to the overlapping in ground-truth bound-
ing boxes, as shown in Fig. 1 (right). In Table 2, we show
the ratios of the ambiguous samples to all positive samples
on minival split. As shown in the table, there are indeed a
large amount of ambiguous samples ( 23.16%) if FPN is not
used and only feature level P4 is used. However, with FPN,
the ratio can be significantly reduced to only 7.14% since
most of overlapped objects are assigned to different feature
levels. Moreover, we argue that the ambiguous samples re-
sulted from overlapping between objects of the same cate-
gory do not matter. For instance, if object A and B with the
same class have overlap, no matter which object the loca-
tions in the overlap predict, the prediction is correct because
it is always matched with the same category. The missed ob-
ject can be predicted by the locations only belonging to it.
Therefore, we only count the ambiguous samples in over-
lap between bounding boxes with different categories. As
shown in Table 2, the multi-level prediction reduces the ra-
tio of ambiguous samples from 17.84% to 3.75%. In order
to further show that the overlapping in ground truth boxes is
not a problem of our FCN-based FCOS, we count that when
inferring how many detected bounding boxes come from
the ambiguous locations. We found that only 2.3% detected
bounding boxes are produced by the ambiguous locations.
By further only considering the overlap between different
categories, the ratio is reduced to 1.5%. Note that it does
not imply that there are 1.5% locations where FCOS cannot
work. As mentioned before, these locations are associated
with the ground-truth boxes with minimal area. Therefore,
these locations only take the risk of missing some larger ob-
jects. As shown in the following experiments, they do not

our anchor-free FCOS achieves even better performance than anchor-based RetinaNet both in AP and AR. With Group Normalization (GN) in heads and
NMS threshold being 0.6, FCOS can achieve 37.1 in AP . After our submission, some almost cost-free improvements have been made for FCOS and the
performance has been improved by a large margin, as shown by the rows below “ Improvements”. “ctr. on reg.”: moving the center-ness branch to the

make our FCOS inferior to anchor-based detectors.
4.1.2 With or Without Center-ness
As mentioned before, we propose “center-ness” to suppress
the low-quality detected bounding boxes produced by the
locations far from the center of an object. As shown in
Table 4, the center-ness branch can boost AP from 33.5%
to 37.1%, making anchor-free FCOS outperform anchor-
based RetinaNet ( 35.9%). Note that anchor-based Reti-
naNet employs two IoU thresholds to label anchor boxes as
positive/negative samples, which can also help to suppress
the low-quality predictions. The proposed center-ness can
eliminate the two hyper-parameters. However, after our ini-
tial submission, it has shown that using both center-ness and
the thresholds can result in a better performance, as shown
by the row “+ ctr. sampling” in Table 3. One may note
that center-ness can also be computed with the predicted
regression vector without introducing the extra center-ness
branch. However, as shown in Table 4, the center-ness com-
puted from the regression vector cannot improve the perfor-
mance and thus the separate center-ness is necessary.
4.1.3 FCOS vs. Anchor-based Detectors
The aforementioned FCOS has two minor differences from
the standard RetinaNet. 1) We use Group Normalization
(GN) [29] in the newly added convolutional layers except
for the last prediction layers, which makes our training more
stable. 2) We use P5 to produce the P6 and P7 instead of
C5 in the standard RetinaNet. We observe that using P5 can
improve the performance slightly.
To show that our FCOS can serve as an simple and strong
alternative of anchor-based detectors, and for a fair compar-
ison, we remove GN (the gradients are clipped to prevent
them from exploding) and use C5 in our detector. As shown
in Table 3, with exactly the same settings, our FCOS still
compares favorably with the anchor-based detector ( 36.3%
vs 35.9%). Moreover, it is worth to note that we directly use
all hyper-parameters (e.g., learning rate, the NMS threshold
and etc.) from RetinaNet, which have been optimized for
the anchor-based detector. We argue that the performance
of FCOS can be improved further if the hyper-parameters
are tuned for it.
It is worth noting that with some almost cost-free im-
provements, as shown in Table 3, the performance of
our anchor-free detector can be improved by a large mar-
gin. Given the superior performance and the merits of the
anchor-free detector ( e.g., much simpler and fewer hyper-
parameters than anchor-based detectors), we encourage the
community to rethink the necessity of anchor boxes in ob-
ject detection.
4.2. Comparison with State­of­the­art Detectors
We compare FCOS with other state-of-the-art object de-
tectors on test − dev split of MS-COCO benchmark. For
these experiments, we randomly scale the shorter side of
images in the range from 640 to 800 during the training and
double the number of iterations to 180K (with the learn-
ing rate change points scaled proportionally). Other set-
tings are exactly the same as the model with AP 37.1% in
Table 3. As shown in Table 5, with ResNet-101-FPN, our
FCOS outperforms the RetinaNet with the same backbone
ResNet-101-FPN by 2.4% in AP . To our knowledge, it is

less design complexity. Refer to Table 3 for details of “improvements”.

the first time that an anchor-free detector, without any bells
and whistles outperforms anchor-based detectors by a large
margin. FCOS also outperforms other classical two-stage
anchor-based detectors such as Faster R-CNN by a large
margin. With ResNeXt-64x4d-101-FPN [30] as the back-
bone, FCOS achieves 43.2% in AP . It outperforms the re-
cent state-of-the-art anchor-free detector CornerNet [13] by
a large margin while being much simpler. Note that Cor-
nerNet requires to group corners with embedding vectors,
which needs special design for the detector. Thus, we ar-
gue that FCOS is more likely to serve as a strong and sim-
ple alternative to current mainstream anchor-based detec-
tors. Moreover, FCOS with the improvements in Table 3
achieves 44.7% in AP with single-model and single scale
testing, which surpasses previous detectors by a large mar-
gin.
5. Extensions on Region Proposal Networks
So far we have shown that in a one-stage detector, our
FCOS can achieve even better performance than anchor-
based counterparts. Intuitively, FCOS should be also able
to replace the anchor boxes in Region Proposal Networks
(RPNs) with FPN [14] in the two-stage detector Faster R-
CNN. Here, we confirm that by experiments.
Compared to RPNs with FPN [14], we replace anchor
boxes with the method in FCOS. Moreover, we add GN into
the layers in FPN heads, which can make our training more
stable. All other settings are exactly the same with RPNs
with FPN in the official code [7]. As shown in Table 6, even
without the proposed center-ness branch, our FCOS already
improves both AR100 and AR1k significantly. With the pro-
posed center-ness branch, FCOS further boosts AR 100 and
AR1k respectively to 52.8% and 60.3%, which are 18% rel-
ative improvement for AR 100 and 3.4% absolute improve-
ment for AR 1k over the RPNs with FPN.
6. Conclusion
We have proposed an anchor-free and proposal-free one-
stage detector FCOS. As shown in experiments, FCOS
compares favourably against the popular anchor-based one-
stage detectors, including RetinaNet, YOLO and SSD,
but with much less design complexity. FCOS completely
avoids all computation and hyper-parameters related to an-
chor boxes and solves the object detection in a per-pixel pre-
diction fashion, similar to other dense prediction tasks such
as semantic segmentation. FCOS also achieves state-of-the-
art performance among one-stage detectors. We also show
that FCOS can be used as RPNs in the two-stage detector
Faster R-CNN and outperforms the its RPNs by a large mar-
gin. Given its effectiveness and efficiency, we hope that
FCOS can serve as a strong and simple alternative of cur-
rent mainstream anchor-based detectors. We also believe
that FCOS can be extended to solve many other instance-
level recognition tasks.
