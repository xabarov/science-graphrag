## Abstract

One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense classification and
localization (i.e., bounding box regression). The classification is usually optimized
by Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta distribu-
tion. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an individual prediction
branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the predicted quality facili-
tates the classification to improve detection performance. This paper delves into
the representations of the above three fundamental elements: quality estimation,
classification and localization. Two problems are discovered in existing practices,
including (1) the inconsistent usage of the quality estimation and classification
between training and inference (i.e., separately trained but compositely used in
test) and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization when there is
ambiguity and uncertainty which is often the case in complex scenes. To address
the problems, we design new representations for these elements. Specifically, we
merge the quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint repre-
sentation of localization quality and classification, and use a vector to represent
arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations eliminate
the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible distribution in real data,
but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the scope of Focal Loss. We then
propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete
form to the continuous version for successful optimization. On COCO test-dev,
GFL achieves 45.0% AP using ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art
SAPD (43.5%) and ATSS (43.6%) with higher or comparable inference speed,
under the same backbone and training settings. Notably, our best model can achieve
a single-model single-scale AP of 48.2%, at 10 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU. Code
and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/implus/GFocal.

1 Introduction
Recently, dense detectors have gradually led the trend of object detection, whilst the attention on
the representation of bounding boxes and their localization quality estimation leads to the encour-
aging advancement. Specifically, bounding boxrepresentation is modeled as a simple Dirac delta
distribution [10, 18, 32, 26, 31], which is widely used over past years. As popularized in FCOS [26],

predicting an additional localization quality (e.g., IoU score [ 29] or centerness score [26]) brings
consistent improvements of detection accuracy, when the quality estimation is combined (usually
multiplied) with classification confidence as final scores [12, 11, 26, 29, 35] for the rank process of
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) during inference. Despite their success, we observe the following
problems in existing practices:
Inconsistent usage of localization quality estimation and classification score between training
and inference: (1) In recent dense detectors, the localization quality estimation and classification
score are usually trained independently but compositely utilized (e.g., multiplication) during inference
[26, 29] (Fig. 1(a)); (2) The supervision of the localization quality estimation is currently assigned
for positive samples only [ 12, 11, 26, 29, 35], which is unreliable as negatives may get chances
to have uncontrollably higher quality predictions (Fig. 2(a)). These two factors result in a gap
between training and test, and would potentially degrade the detection performance, e.g., negative
instances with randomly high-quality scores could rank in front of positive examples with lower
quality prediction during NMS.

We demonstrate some background patches (A and B) with extremely high predicted
quality scores (e.g., IoU score > 0.9), based on the optimized IoU-branch model in
Fig. 1(a). The scatter diagram in (b) denotes the randomly sampled instances with
their predicted scores, where the blue points clearly illustrate the weak correlation be-
tween predicted classification scores and predicted IoU scores for separate representa-
tions. The part in red circle contains many possible negatives with large localization
quality predictions, which may potentially rank in front of true positives and impair
the performance. Instead, our joint representation (green points) forces them to be
equal and thus avoids such risks.
Inflexible representation of bound-
ing boxes: The widely used bound-
ing box representation can be viewed
as Dirac delta distribution [7, 23, 8, 1,
18, 26, 13, 31] of the target box coordi-
nates. However, it fails to consider the
ambiguity and uncertainty in datasets
(see the unclear boundaries of the fig-
ures in Fig. 3). Although some recent
works [10, 4] model boxes as Gaus-
sian distributions, it is too simple to
capture the real distribution of the lo-
cations of bounding boxes. In fact,
the real distribution can be more ar-
bitrary and flexible [ 10], without the
necessity of being symmetric like the
Gaussian function.
To address the above problems, we design new representations for the bounding boxes and their
localization quality. For localization quality representation , we propose to merge it with the
classification score into a single and unified representation: a classification vector where its value
at the ground-truth category index refers to its corresponding localization quality (typically the IoU
score between the predicted box and the corresponding ground-truth box in this paper). In this way,
we unify classification score and IoU score into a joint and single variable (denoted as “classification-
IoU joint representation”), which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, whilst directly utilized
during inference (Fig. 1(b)). As a result, it eliminates the training-test inconsistency (Fig. 1(b))
and enables the strongest correlation (Fig. 2 (b)) between localization quality and classification.
Further, the negatives will be supervised with 0 quality scores, thereby the overall quality predictions
become more confidential and reliable. It is especially beneficial for dense object detectors as they
rank all candidates regularly sampled across an entire image. For bounding box representation,
we propose to represent the arbitrary distribution (denoted as “General distribution” in this paper)
of box locations by directly learning the discretized probability distribution over its continuous
space, without introducing any other stronger priors (e.g., Gaussian [10, 4]). Consequently, we can
obtain more reliable and accurate bounding box estimations, whilst being aware of a variety of their
underlying distributions (see the predicted distributions in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Materials).

Figure 3: Due to occlusion, shadow, blur, etc., the boundaries of many objects are not clear enough, so that the ground-truth labels (white
boxes) are sometimes not credible and Dirac delta distribution is limited to indicate such issues. Instead, the proposed learned representation
of General distribution for bounding boxes can reflect the underlying information by its shape, where a flatten distribution denotes the unclear
and ambiguous boundaries (see red circles) and a sharp one stands for the clear cases. The predicted boxes by our model are marked green.
The improved representations then pose challenges for optimization. Traditionally for dense detectors,
the classification branch is optimized with Focal Loss [18] (FL). FL can successfully handles the
class imbalance problem via reshaping the standard cross entropy loss. However, for the case of the
proposed classification-IoU joint representation, in addition to the imbalance risk that still exists, we
face a new problem with continuous IoU label (0∼1) as supervisions, as the original FL only supports
discrete{1, 0} category label currently. We successfully solve the problem by extending FL from
{1, 0} discrete version to its continuous variant, termed Generalized Focal Loss (GFL). Different
from FL, GFL considers a much general case in which the globally optimized solution is able to target
at any desired continuous value, rather than the discrete ones. More specifically in this paper, GFL
can be specialized into Quality Focal Loss (QFL) and Distribution Focal Loss (DFL), for optimizing
the improved two representations respectively: QFL focuses on a sparse set of hard examples and
simultaneously produces their continuous 0∼1 quality estimations on the corresponding category;
DFL makes the network to rapidly focus on learning the probabilities of values around thecontinuous
locations of target bounding boxes, under an arbitrary and flexible distribution.
We demonstrate three advantages of GFL: (1) It bridges the gap between training and test when
one-stage detectors are facilitated with additional quality estimation, leading to a simpler, joint
and effective representation of both classification and localization quality; (2) It well models the
flexible underlying distribution for bounding boxes, which provides more informative and accurate
box locations; (3) The performance of one-stage detectors can be consistently boosted without
introducing additional overhead. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0% AP with ResNet-101
backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5%) and ATSS (43.6%). Our best model can achieve
a single-model single-scale AP of 48.2% whilst running at 10 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU.
2 Related Work
Representation of localization quality. Existing practices like Fitness NMS [27], IoU-Net [12], MS
R-CNN [11], FCOS [26] and IoU-aware [29] utilize a separate branch to perform localization quality
estimation in a form of IoU or centerness score. As mentioned in Sec. 1, this separate formulation
causes the inconsistency between training and test as well as unreliable quality predictions. Instead
of introducing an additional branch, PISA [2] and IoU-balance [28] assign different weights in the
classification loss based on their localization qualities, aiming at enhancing the correlation between
the classification score and localization accuracy. However, the weight strategy is of implicit and
limited benefits since it does not change the optimum of the loss objectives for classification.
Representation of bounding boxes. Dirac delta distribution [7, 23, 8, 1, 18, 26, 13, 31] governs the
representation of bounding boxes over past years. Recently, Gaussian assumption [10, 4] is adopted
to learn the uncertainty by introducing a predicted variance. Unfortunately, existing representations
are either too rigid or too simplified, which can not reflect the complex underlying distribution in
real data. In this paper, we further relax the assumption and directly learn the more arbitrary, flexible
General distribution of bounding boxes, whilst being more informative and accurate.

In this section, we first review the original Focal Loss [18] (FL) for learning dense classification scores
of one-stage detectors. Next, we present the details for the improved representations of localization
quality estimation and bounding boxes, which are successfully optimized via the proposed Quality

formulations of QFL and DFL into a unified perspective termed Generalized Focal Loss (GFL), as a
flexible extension of FL, to facilitate further promotion and general understanding in the future.
Focal Loss (FL). The original FL [18] is proposed to address the one-stage object detection scenario
where an extreme imbalance between foreground and background classes often exists during training.
A typical form of FL is as follows (we ignoreαt in original paper [18] for simplicity):
FL(p) =−(1−pt)γ log(pt),pt =
{
p, when y = 1
1−p, when y = 0 (1)
wherey∈{ 1, 0} specifies the ground-truth class andp∈ [0, 1] denotes the estimated probability for
the class with labely = 1.γ is the tunable focusing parameter. Specifically, FL consists of a standard
cross entropy part− log(pt) and a dynamically scaling factor part (1−pt)γ, where the scaling factor
(1−pt)γ automatically down-weights the contribution of easy examples during training and rapidly
focuses the model on hard examples.
Quality Focal Loss (QFL). To solve the aforementioned inconsistency problem between training and
test phases, we present a joint representation of localization quality (i.e., IoU score) and classification
score (“classification-IoU” for short), where its supervision softens the standard one-hot category
label and leads to a possible float targety∈ [0, 1] on the corresponding category (see the classification
branch in Fig. 4). Specifically,y = 0 denotes the negative samples with 0 quality score, and0<y ≤ 1
stands for the positive samples with target IoU score y. Note that the localization quality label y
follows the conventional definition as in [29, 12]: IoU score between the predicted bounding box
and its corresponding ground-truth bounding box during training, with a dynamic value being 0∼1.
Following [18, 26], we adopt the multiple binary classification with sigmoid operators σ(·) for
multi-class implementation. For simplicity, the output of sigmoid is marked asσ.
Since the proposed classification-IoU joint representation requires dense supervisions over an entire
image and the class imbalance problem still occurs, the idea of FL must be inherited. However,
the current form of FL only supports {1, 0} discrete labels, but our new labels contain decimals.
Therefore, we propose to extend the two parts of FL for enabling the successful training under the
case of joint representation: (1) The cross entropy part − log(pt) is expanded into its complete
version−
(
(1−y) log(1−σ) +y log(σ)
)
; (2) The scaling factor part (1−pt)γ is generalized into
the absolute distance between the estimation σ and its continuous label y, i.e.,|y−σ|β (β≥ 0),
here|·| guarantees the non-negativity. Subsequently, we combine the above two extended parts to
formulate the complete loss objective, which is termed as Quality Focal Loss (QFL):
QFL(σ) =−
⏐⏐y−σ
⏐⏐β(
(1−y) log(1−σ) +y log(σ)
)
. (2)
Note thatσ = y is the global minimum solution of QFL. QFL is visualized for several values of
β in Fig. 5(a) under quality label y = 0.5. Similar to FL, the term
⏐⏐y−σ
⏐⏐β
of QFL behaves as a
modulating factor: when the quality estimation of an example is inaccurate and deviated away from
labely, the modulating factor is relatively large, thus it pays more attention to learning this hard
example. As the quality estimation becomes accurate, i.e.,σ→y, the factor goes to 0 and the loss for
well-estimated examples is down-weighted, in which the parameterβ controls the down-weighting
rate smoothly (β = 2 works best for QFL in our experiments).
Distribution Focal Loss (DFL). Following [26, 31], we adopt the relative offsets from the location
to the four sides of a bounding box as the regression targets (see the regression branch in Fig. 4).

∫ +∞
−∞ δ(x−y) dx = 1 and is usually implemented through
fully connected layers. More formally, the integral form to recovery is as follows:
y =
∫ +∞
−∞
δ(x−y)x dx. (3)
According to the analysis in Sec. 1, instead of the Dirac delta [ 23, 8, 1, 26, 31] or Gaussian [ 4,
10] assumptions, we propose to directly learn the underlying General distribution P (x) without
introducing any other priors. Given the range of labely with minimumy0 and maximumyn (y0≤
y≤yn,n∈ N+), we can have the estimated value ˆy from the model (ˆy also meetsy0≤ ˆy≤yn):
ˆy =
∫ +∞
−∞
P (x)x dx =
∫ yn
y0
P (x)x dx. (4)
To be consistent with convolutional neural networks, we convert the integral over the con-
tinuous domain into a discrete representation, via discretizing the range [y0,yn] into a set
{y0,y 1,...,y i,yi+1,...,y n−1,yn} with even intervals ∆ (we use ∆ = 1 for simplicity). Conse-
quently, given the discrete distribution property∑n
i=0P (yi) = 1 , the estimated regression value ˆy
can be presented as:
ˆy =
n∑
i=0
P (yi)yi. (5)
As a result,P (x) can be easily implemented through a softmaxS(·) layer consisting ofn + 1 units,
withP (yi) being denoted asSi for simplicity. Note that ˆy can be trained in an end-to-end fashion
with traditional loss objectives like SmoothL1 [7], IoU Loss [27] or GIoU Loss [24]. However, there
are infinite combinations of values forP (x) that can make the final integral result beingy, as shown
in Fig. 5(b), which may reduce the learning efficiency. Intuitively compared against (1) and (2),
distribution (3) is compact and tends to be more confident and precise on the bounding box estimation,
which motivates us to optimize the shape ofP (x) via explicitly encouraging the high probabilities
of values that are close to the target y. Furthermore, it is often the case that the most appropriate
underlying location, if exists, would not be far away from the coarse label. Therefore, we introduce
the Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) which forces the network to rapidly focus on the values near label
y, by explicitly enlarging the probabilities ofyi andyi+1 (nearest two toy,yi≤y≤yi+1). As the
learning of bounding boxes are only for positive samples without the risk of class imbalance problem,
we simply apply the complete cross entropy part in QFL for the definition of DFL:
DFL(Si,Si+1) =−
(
(yi+1−y) log(Si) + (y−yi) log(Si+1)
)
. (6)
Intuitively, DFL aims to focus on enlarging the probabilities of the values around targety (i.e.,yi and
yi+1). The global minimum solution of DFL, i.e,Si = yi+1−y
yi+1−yi
,Si+1 = y−yi
yi+1−yi
(see Supplementary
Materials), can guarantee the estimated regression target ˆy infinitely close to the corresponding label
y, i.e., ˆy =∑n
j=0P (yj)yj =Siyi +Si+1yi+1 = yi+1−y
yi+1−yi
yi + y−yi
yi+1−yi
yi+1 =y, which also ensures
its correctness as a loss function.

Generalized Focal Loss (GFL). Note that QFL and DFL can be unified into a general form, which
is called the Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) in the paper. Assume that a model estimates probabilities
for two variablesyl,yr(yl <y r) aspyl,pyr (pyl≥ 0,pyr≥ 0,pyl +pyr = 1), with a final prediction
of their linear combination being ˆy =ylpyl +yrpyr (yl≤ ˆy≤yr). The corresponding continuous
labely for the prediction ˆy also satisfiesyl≤y≤yr. Taking the absolute distance|y− ˆy|β (β≥ 0)
as modulating factor, the specific formulation of GFL can be written as:
GFL(pyl,pyr ) =−
⏐⏐y− (ylpyl +yrpyr )
⏐⏐β(
(yr−y) log(pyl ) + (y−yl) log(pyr )
)
. (7)
Properties of GFL. GFL (pyl,pyr ) reaches its global minimum with p∗
yl = yr−y
yr−yl
,p∗
yr = y−yl
yr−yl
,
which also means that the estimation ˆy perfectly matches the continuous labely, i.e., ˆy =ylp∗
yl +
yrp∗
yr = y (see the proof in Supplementary Materials). Obviously, the original FL [ 18] and the
proposed QFL and DFL are all special cases of GFL (see Supplementary Materials for details).
Note that GFL can be applied to any one-stage detectors. The modified detectors differ from the
original detectors in two aspects. First, during inference, we directly feed the classification score
(joint representation with quality estimation) as NMS scores without the need of multiplying any
individual quality prediction if there exists (e.g., centerness as in FCOS [26] and ATSS [31]). Second,
the last layer of the regression branch for predicting each location of bounding boxes now hasn + 1
outputs instead of 1 output, which brings negligible extra computing cost as later shown in Table 3.

whereLQ is QFL andLD is DFL. Typically,LB denotes the GIoU Loss as in [26, 31].Npos stands
for the number of positive samples.λ0 (typically 2 as default, similarly in [3]) andλ1 (practically 1
4,
averaged over four directions) are the balance weights forLQ andLD, respectively. The summation
is calculated over all locationsz on the pyramid feature maps [17]. 1{c∗z>0} is the indicator function,
being 1 ifc∗
z > 0 and 0 otherwise. Following the common practices in the official codes [3, 26, 31, 15],
we also utilize the quality scores to weightLB andLD during training.

4 Experiment
Our experiments are conducted on COCO benchmark [19], where trainval35k (115K images) is
utilized for training and we use minival (5K images) as validation for our ablation study. The main
results are reported on test-dev (20K images) which can be obtained from the evaluation server. For
fair comparisons, all results are produced under mmdetection [3], where the default hyper-parameters
are adopted. Unless otherwise stated, we adopt 1x learning schedule (12 epochs) without multi-scale
training for the following studies, based on ResNet-50 [9] backbone. More training/test details can
be found in Supplementary Materials.

GFL achieves better speed-accuracy trade-off than many com-
petitive counterparts.
We first investigate the effectiveness of the QFL (Ta-
ble 1). In Table 1(a), we compare the proposed joint
representation with its separate or implicit counter-
parts. Two alternatives for representing localization
quality: IoU [29, 12] and centerness [26, 31] are also
adopted in the experiments. In general, we construct
4 variants that use separate or implicit representation,
as illustrated in Fig. 6. According to the results, we
observe that the joint representations optimized by
QFL consistently achieve better performance than all
the counterparts, whilst IoU always performs better
than centerness as a measurement of localization qual-
ity (Supplementary Materials). Table 1(b) shows that
QFL can also boost the performance of other popular
one-stage detectors, and Table 1(c) shows thatβ = 2
is the best setting for QFL. We illustrate the effectiveness of joint representation by sampling instances
with its predicted classification and IoU scores of both IoU-branch model and ours, as shown in
Fig. 2(b). It demonstrates that the proposed joint representation trained with QFL can benefit the
detection due to its more reliable quality estimation, and yields the strongest correlation between
classification and quality scores according to its definition. In fact, in our joint representation, the
predicted classification score is equal to the estimated quality score exactly.

Table 3: The effect of QFL and DFL on ATSS : The
effects of QFL and DFL are orthogonal, whilst utilizing
both can boost 1% AP over the strong ATSS baseline,
without introducing additional overhead practically.
Second, we investigate the effectiveness of the DFL (Ta-
ble 2). To quickly select a reasonable value of n, we
first illustrate the distribution of the regression targets in
Fig. 5(c). We will show in later experiments, the recom-
mended choice ofn for ATSS is 14 or 16. In Table 2(a), we
compare the effectiveness of different data representations
for bounding box regression. We find that the General dis-
tribution achieves superior or at least comparable results,
whilst DFL can further boost its performance. Qualitative
comparisons are depicted in Fig. 7. It is observed that the
proposed General distribution can provide more accurate bounding box locations than Gaussian and

Dirac delta distribution, especially under the case with considerable occlusions (More discussions in
Supplementary Materials). Based on the improved ATSS trained by GFL, we report the effect ofn
and∆ in DFL by fixing one and varying another in Table 2(b) and (c). The results demonstrate that
the selection ofn is not sensitive and∆ is suggested to be small (e.g., 1) in practice. To illustrate the
effect of General distribution, we plot several representative instances with its distributed bounding
box over four directions in Fig. 3, where the proposed distributed representation can effectively reflect
the uncertainty of bounding boxes by its shape (see more examples in Supplementary Materials).
Third, we perform the ablation study on ATSS with ResNet-50 backbone to show the relative
contributions of QFL and DFL (Table 3). FPS (Frames-per-Second) is measured on the same machine
with a single GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU using a batch size of 1 under the same mmdetection [ 3]
framework. We observe that the improvement of DFL is orthogonal to QFL, and joint usage of both
(i.e., GFL) improves the strong ATSS baseline by absolute 1% AP score. Furthermore, according to
the inference speeds, GFL brings negligible additional overhead and is considered very practical.
Finally, we compare GFL (based on ATSS) with state-of-the-art approaches on COCOtest-dev in
Table 4. Following previous works [18, 26], the multi-scale training strategy and 2x learning schedule
(24 epochs) are adopted during training. For a fair comparison, we report the results of single-model
single-scale testing for all methods, as well as their corresponding inference speeds (FPS). GFL with
ResNet-101 [9] achieves 45.0% AP at 14.6 FPS, which is superior than all the existing detectors with
the same backbone, including SAPD [ 33] (43.5%) and ATSS [31] (43.6%). Further, Deformable

Convolutional Networks (DCN) [36] consistently boost the performances over ResNe(X)t backbones,
where GFL with ResNeXt-101-32x4d-DCN obtains state-of-the-art 48.2% AP at 10 FPS. Fig. 8
demonstrates the visualization of the accuracy-speed trade-off, where it can be observed that our
proposed GFL pushes the envelope of accuracy-speed boundary to a high level.
5 Conclusion
To effectively learn qualified and distributed bounding boxes for dense object detectors, we propose
Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that generalizes the original Focal Loss from{1, 0} discrete formula-
tion to the continuous version. GFL can be specialized into Quality Focal loss (QFL) and Distribution
Focal Loss (DFL), where QFL encourages to learn a better joint representation of classification and
localization quality, and DFL provides more informative and precise bounding box estimations by
modeling their locations as General distributions. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
GFL. We hope GFL can serve as a simple yet effective baseline for the community.

A More Discussions about the Distributions
Fig. 9 depicts the ideas of Dirac delta, Gaussian, and the proposed General distributions, where the assumption
goes from rigid (Dirac delta) to flexible (General). We also list several key comparisons about these distributions
in Table 5. It can be observed that the loss objective of the Gaussian assumption is actually a dynamically
weighted L2 Loss, where its training weight is related to the predicted varianceσ. It is somehow similar to that
of Dirac delta (standard L2 Loss) when optimized at the edge level. Moreover, it is not clear how to integrate
the Gaussian assumption into the IoU-based Loss formulations, since it heavily couples the expression of the
target representation with its optimization objective. Therefore, it can not enjoy the benefits of the IoU-based
optimization [24], as it is proved to be very effective in practice. In contrast, our proposed General distribution
decouples the representation and loss objective, making it feasible for any type of optimizations, including both
edge level and box level.

Figure 9: Illustrations of three distributions, from rigid (Dirac delta) to flexible (General). The proposed General distribution is more flexible

Figure 10: We demonstrate an example in 2D space by fixing the input feature vector and introduce a small disturbance (norm of 0.1) over it.
The regression targets are 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 respectively. It is observed that Dirac delta distribution leads to more regression errors after the same
disturbance, and the error increases with the growth of regression target. In contrast, our proposed General distribution remains stable and
insensitive to the disturbance.
We also find that the bounding box regression of Dirac delta distribution (including Gaussian distribution
based on the analysis from Table 5) behaves more sensitive to feature perturbations, making it less robust and
susceptible to noise, as shown in the simulation experiment (Fig. 10). It proves that General distribution enjoys
more benefits than the other counterparts.
B Global Minimum of GFL (pyl, pyr)
Let’s review the definition ofGFL:
GFL(pyl,pyr ) =−
⏐⏐y− (ylpyl +yrpyr )
⏐⏐β(
(yr−y) log(pyl ) + (y−yl) log(pyr )
)
, given pyl +pyr = 1.
11

For simplicity, GFL(pyl,pyr ) can then be expanded as:
GFL(pyl,pyr ) =−
⏐⏐y− (ylpyl +yrpyr )
⏐⏐β(
(yr−y) log(pyl ) + (y−yl) log(pyr )
)
=

⏐⏐β

,p ∗
yr = y−yl

Furthermore, givenε̸= 0, for arbitrary variable (pyl,pyr ) = (p∗
yl +ε,p ∗
yr−ε) in the domain of definition, we
can have:
R(p∗
yl +ε,p ∗
yr−ε)> R(pyl,pyr )> 0,
L(p∗
yl +ε,p ∗
yr−ε) =
⏐⏐ε(yr−yl)
⏐⏐β
> 0 = L(p∗
yl,p ∗
yr ).
Therefore, it is easy to deduce:
GFL(pyl,pyr ) = L(pyl,pyr )R(pyl,pyr )≥ L(p∗
yl,p ∗
yr )R(p∗
yl,p ∗
yr ) = 0,
where “ =” holds only when pyl =p∗
yl,pyr =p∗
yr .
The global minimum property of GFL somehow explains why the IoU or centerness guided variants in Fig. 6
would not have obvious advantages. In fact, the weighted guidance does not essentially change the global
minimum of the original classification loss (e.g., Focal Loss), whilst their optimal classification targets are still
one-hot labels. In contrast, the proposed GFL indeed modifies the global minimum and force the predictions to
approach the accurate IoU between the estimated boxes and ground-truth boxes, which is obviously beneficial
for the rank process of NMS.
C FL, QFL and DFL are special cases of GFL
In this section, we show how GFL can be specialized into the form of FL, QFL and DFL, respectively.
FL: Lettingβ =γ,yl = 0,yr = 1,pyr =p,pyl = 1−p andy∈{ 1, 0} in GFL, we can obtain FL:
FL(p) = GFL(1−p,p ) =−

)
,y∈{ 1, 0}
=−(1−pt)γ log(pt),pt =

p, when y = 1
1−p, when y = 0
(9)
QFL: Havingyl = 0,yr = 1,pyr =σ andpyl = 1−σ in GFL, the form of QFL can be written as:
QFL(σ) = GFL(1−σ,σ ) =−
⏐⏐y−σ
⏐⏐β(
(1−y) log(1−σ) +y log(σ)
)
. (10)
DFL: By substitutingβ = 0,yl = yi,yr = yi+1,pyl = P (yl) = P (yi) =Si,pyr = P (yr) = P (yi+1) =
Si+1 in GFL, we can have DFL:

D Details of Experimental Settings
Training Details: The ImageNet pretrained models [9] with FPN [17] are utilized as the backbones. During
training, the input images are resized to keep their shorter side being 800 and their longer side less or equal to
1333. In ablation study, the networks are trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for
90K iterations (denoted as 1x schedule) with 0.9 momentum, 0.0001 weight decay and 16 batch size. The initial
learning rate is set as 0.01 and decayed by 0.1 at iteration 60K and 80K, respectively.
Inference Details: During inference, the input image is resized in the same way as in the training phase, and
then passed through the whole network to output the predicted bounding boxes with a predicted class. Then we
12

use the threshold 0.05 to filter out a variety of backgrounds, and output top 1000 candidate detections per feature
pyramid. Finally, NMS is applied under the IoU threshold 0.6 per class to produce the final top 100 detections
per image as results.
E Why is IoU-branch always superior than centerness-branch?
The ablation study in original paper also demonstrates that for FCOS/ATSS, IoU performs consistently better
than centerness, as a measurement of localization quality. Here we give a convincing reason why this is the case.
We discover the major problem of centerness is that its definition leads to unexpected small ground-truth label,
which makes a possible set of ground-truth bounding boxes extremely hard to be recalled (as shown in Fig. 11).
From the label distributions demonstrated in Fig. 12, we observe that most of IoU labels is larger than 0.4 yet
centerness labels tend to be much smaller (even approaching 0). The small values of centerness labels prevent a
set of ground-truth bounding boxes from being recalled, as their final scores for NMS would be potentially small
since their predicted centerness scores are already supervised by these extremely small signals.

Figure 11: We demonstrate possible cases of ground-truth/predicted bounding box along with the positive points. The matrix points denote the
feature pyramid layer with stride = 8. Centerness label is easier to get very small values by its definition, whilst IoU label is more reliable as
the supervisions from bounding boxes will always push it close to 1.0.

F More Examples of Distributed Bounding Boxes
We demonstrate more examples with General distributed bounding boxes predicted by GFL (ResNet-50 back-
bone). As demonstrated in Fig. 13, we show several cases with boundary ambiguities: does the slim and almost
invisible backpack strap belong to the box of the bag (left top)? does the partially occluded umbrella handle
belong to the entire umbrella (left down)? In these cases, our models even produce more reasonable coordinates
of bounding boxes than the ground-truth ones. In Fig. 14, more examples with clear boundaries and sharp
General distributions are shown, where GFL is very confident to generate accurate bounding boxes, e.g., the
bottom parts of the orange and skiing woman.

Figure 13: Examples with huge boundary ambiguities and uncertainties, where the learned General distributions tend to be flatten. In some
cases, we even observe a distribution with two peaks. Interestingly, they do correspond to two different most likely boundaries in the image, e.g.,
the boundaries of the umbrella whether its heavily occluded handle is considered. Predictions are marked green in images, whilst ground-truth
boxes are white.
