ments to YOLO series, forming a new high-performance
detector — YOLOX. We switch the YOLO detector to an
anchor-free manner and conduct other advanced detection
techniques, i.e., a decoupled head and the leading label
assignment strategy SimOTA to achieve state-of-the-art re-
sults across a large scale range of models: F or YOLO-

get 25.3% AP on COCO, surpassing NanoDet by 1.8% AP;
for YOLOv3, one of the most widely used detectors in in-
dustry, we boost it to 47.3% AP on COCO, outperform-
ing the current best practice by 3.0% AP; for YOLOX-L
with roughly the same amount of parameters as YOLOv4-

speed of 68.9 FPS on Tesla V100, exceeding YOLOv5-L
by 1.8% AP . Further , we won the 1st Place on Streaming

1. Introduction
With the development of object detection, YOLO se-
ries [23, 24, 25, 1, 7] always pursuit the optimal speed and
accuracy trade-off for real-time applications. They extract
the most advanced detection technologies available at the
time (e.g., anchors [26] for YOLOv2 [24], Residual Net [9]
for YOLOv3 [25]) and optimize the implementation for best
practice. Currently, YOLOv5 [7] holds the best trade-off
performance with 48.2% AP on COCO at 13.7 ms.1
Nevertheless, over the past two years, the major ad-
vances in object detection academia have focused on
anchor-free detectors [29, 40, 14], advanced label assign-
ment strategies [37, 36, 12, 41, 22, 4], and end-to-end
(NMS-free) detectors [2, 32, 39]. These have not been inte-
grated into YOLO families yet, as YOLOv4 and YOLOv5
1we choose the YOLOv5-L model at 640× 640 resolution and test the
model with FP16-precision and batch=1 on a V100 to align the settings of

are still anchor-based detectors with hand-crafted assigning
rules for training.
That’s what brings us here, delivering those recent ad-
vancements to YOLO series with experienced optimiza-
tion. Considering YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 may be a little
over-optimized for the anchor-based pipeline, we choose
YOLOv3 [25] as our start point (we set YOLOv3-SPP as
the default YOLOv3). Indeed, YOLOv3 is still one of the
most widely used detectors in the industry due to the limited
computation resources and the insufficient software support
in various practical applications.
As shown in Fig. 1, with the experienced updates of
the above techniques, we boost the YOLOv3 to 47.3%
AP (YOLOX-DarkNet53) on COCO with 640 × 640 res-
olution, surpassing the current best practice of YOLOv3
(44.3% AP, ultralytics version2) by a large margin. More-
over, when switching to the advanced YOLOv5 architec-
ture that adopts an advanced CSPNet [31] backbone and an
additional PAN [19] head, YOLOX-L achieves 50.0% AP
on COCO with 640 × 640 resolution, outperforming the
counterpart YOLOv5-L by 1.8% AP. We also test our de-
sign strategies on models of small size. YOLOX-Tiny and
YOLOX-Nano (only 0.91M Parameters and 1.08G FLOPs)
outperform the corresponding counterparts YOLOv4-Tiny
and NanoDet3 by 10% AP and 1.8% AP, respectively.
We have released our code at https://github.
com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX, with ONNX,
TensorRT, NCNN and Openvino supported. One more thing
worth mentioning, we won the 1st Place on Streaming Per-
ception Challenge (Workshop on Autonomous Driving at
CVPR 2021) using a single YOLOX-L model.

2.1. YOLOX-DarkNet53
We choose YOLOv3 [25] with Darknet53 as our base-
line. In the following part, we will walk through the whole
system designs in YOLOX step by step.
Implementation details Our training settings are mostly
consistent from the baseline to our final model. We train
the models for a total of 300 epochs with 5 epochs warm-
up on COCO train2017 [17]. We use stochastic gradi-
ent descent (SGD) for training. We use a learning rate of
lr×BatchSize/64 (linear scaling [8]), with a initial lr =
0.01 and the cosine lr schedule. The weight decay is 0.0005
and the SGD momentum is 0.9. The batch size is 128 by
default to typical 8-GPU devices. Other batch sizes in-
clude single GPU training also work well. The input size
is evenly drawn from 448 to 832 with 32 strides. FPS and

latency in this report are all measured with FP16-precision
and batch=1 on a single Tesla V100.
YOLOv3 baseline Our baseline adopts the architec-
ture of DarkNet53 backbone and an SPP layer, referred
to YOLOv3-SPP in some papers [1, 7]. We slightly
change some training strategies compared to the orig-
inal implementation [25], adding EMA weights updat-
ing, cosine lr schedule, IoU loss and IoU-aware branch.
We use BCE Loss for training cls and obj branch,
and IoU Loss for training reg branch. These gen-
eral training tricks are orthogonal to the key improve-
ment of YOLOX, we thus put them on the baseline.
Moreover, we only conduct RandomHorizontalFlip,
ColorJitter and multi-scale for data augmentation and
discard the RandomResizedCrop strategy, because we
found the RandomResizedCrop is kind of overlapped
with the planned mosaic augmentation. With those en-
hancements, our baseline achieves 38.5% AP on COCOval,
as shown in Tab. 2.
Decoupled head In object detection, the conflict between
classification and regression tasks is a well-known prob-
lem [27, 34]. Thus the decoupled head for classification
and localization is widely used in the most of one-stage and
two-stage detectors [16, 29, 35, 34]. However, as YOLO
series’ backbones and feature pyramids ( e.g., FPN [13],
PAN [20].) continuously evolving, their detection heads re-
main coupled as shown in Fig. 2.
Our two analytical experiments indicate that the coupled
detection head may harm the performance. 1). Replacing
YOLO’s head with a decoupled one greatly improves the
converging speed as shown in Fig. 3. 2). The decoupled
head is essential to the end-to-end version of YOLO (will
be described next). One can tell from Tab. 1, the end-to-
end property decreases by 4.2% AP with the coupled head,
while the decreasing reduces to 0.8% AP for a decoupled
head. We thus replace the YOLO detect head with a lite de-
coupled head as in Fig. 2. Concretely, it contains a 1 × 1
conv layer to reduce the channel dimension, followed by
two parallel branches with two 3 × 3 conv layers respec-
tively. We report the inference time with batch=1 on V100
in Tab. 2 and the lite decoupled head brings additional 1.1
ms (11.6 ms v.s. 10.5 ms).

Figure 3: Training curves for detectors with YOLOv3 head
or decoupled head. We evaluate the AP on COCOval every
10 epochs. It is obvious that the decoupled head converges
much faster than the YOLOv3 head and achieves better re-
sult finally.
Strong data augmentation We add Mosaic and MixUp
into our augmentation strategies to boost YOLOX’s per-
formance. Mosaic is an efficient augmentation strategy
proposed by ultralytics-YOLOv3 2. It is then widely used
in YOLOv4 [1], YOLOv5 [7] and other detectors [3].
MixUp [10] is originally designed for image classification
task but then modified in BoF [38] for object detection train-
ing. We adopt the MixUp and Mosaic implementation in
our model and close it for the last 15 epochs, achieving
42.0% AP in Tab. 2. After using strong data augmentation,
we found ImageNet pre-training is no more beneficial, we
thus train all the following models from scratch.
Anchor-free Both YOLOv4 [1] and YOLOv5 [7] fol-
low the original anchor-based pipeline of YOLOv3 [25].
However, the anchor mechanism has many known prob-
lems. First, to achieve optimal detection performance, one
needs to conduct clustering analysis to determine a set of
optimal anchors before training. Those clustered anchors
are domain-specific and less generalized. Second, anchor
mechanism increases the complexity of detection heads, as
well as the number of predictions for each image. On some
edge AI systems, moving such large amount of predictions
between devices ( e.g., from NPU to CPU) may become a
potential bottleneck in terms of the overall latency.
Anchor-free detectors [29, 40, 14] have developed
rapidly in the past two year. These works have shown
that the performance of anchor-free detectors can be on par
with anchor-based detectors. Anchor-free mechanism sig-
nificantly reduces the number of design parameters which
need heuristic tuning and many tricks involved ( e.g., An-
chor Clustering [24], Grid Sensitive [11].) for good per-
formance, making the detector, especially its training and
decoding phase, considerably simpler [29].
Switching YOLO to an anchor-free manner is quite sim-
ple. We reduce the predictions for each location from 3 to 1
and make them directly predict four values, i.e., two offsets
in terms of the left-top corner of the grid, and the height
and width of the predicted box. We assign the center lo-

cation of each object as the positive sample and pre-define
a scale range, as done in [29], to designate the FPN level
for each object. Such modification reduces the parameters
and GFLOPs of the detector and makes it faster, but obtains
better performance – 42.9% AP as shown in Tab. 2.
Multi positives To be consistent with the assigning rule of
YOLOv3, the above anchor-free version selects only ONE
positive sample (the center location) for each object mean-
while ignores other high quality predictions. However, opti-
mizing those high quality predictions may also bring benefi-
cial gradients, which may alleviates the extreme imbalance
of positive/negative sampling during training. We simply
assigns the center 3×3 area as positives, also named “center
sampling” in FCOS [29]. The performance of the detector
improves to 45.0% AP as in Tab. 2, already surpassing the
current best practice of ultralytics-YOLOv3 (44.3% AP2).
SimOTA Advanced label assignment is another important
progress of object detection in recent years. Based on our
own study OTA [4], we conclude four key insights for an
advanced label assignment: 1). loss/quality aware, 2). cen-
ter prior, 3). dynamic number of positive anchors 4 for each
ground-truth (abbreviated as dynamic top-k), 4). global
view. OTA meets all four rules above, hence we choose
it as a candidate label assigning strategy.
Specifically, OTA [4] analyzes the label assignment from
a global perspective and formulate the assigning proce-
dure as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem, producing
the SOTA performance among the current assigning strate-
gies [12, 41, 36, 22, 37]. However, in practice we found
solving OT problem via Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm brings
25% extra training time, which is quite expensive for train-
ing 300 epochs. We thus simplify it to dynamic top-k strat-
egy, named SimOTA, to get an approximate solution.
4The term “anchor” refers to “anchor point” in the context of anchor-
free detectors and “grid” in the context of YOLO.
We briefly introduce SimOTA here. SimOTA first calcu-
lates pair-wise matching degree, represented by cost [4, 5,
12, 2] or quality [33] for each prediction-gt pair. For exam-
ple, in SimOTA, the cost between gtgi and predictionpj is
calculated as:
cij =Lcls
ij +λLreg
ij , (1)
whereλ is a balancing coefficient.Lcls
ij andLreg
ij are class-
ficiation loss and regression loss between gtgi and predic-
tion pj. Then, for gt gi, we select the top k predictions
with the least cost within a fixed center region as its positive
samples. Finally, the corresponding grids of those positive
predictions are assigned as positives, while the rest grids
are negatives. Noted that the value k varies for different
ground-truth. Please refer to Dynamic k Estimation strat-
egy in OTA [4] for more details.
SimOTA not only reduces the training time but also
avoids additional solver hyperparameters in Sinkhorn-
Knopp algorithm. As shown in Tab. 2, SimOTA raises the
detector from 45.0% AP to 47.3% AP, higher than the SOTA
ultralytics-YOLOv3 by 3.0% AP, showing the power of the
advanced assigning strategy.
End-to-end YOLO We follow [39] to add two additional
conv layers, one-to-one label assignment, and stop gradient.
These enable the detector to perform an end-to-end manner,
but slightly decreasing the performance and the inference
speed, as listed in Tab. 2. We thus leave it as an optional
module which is not involved in our final models.
2.2. Other Backbones
Besides DarkNet53, we also test YOLOX on other back-
bones with different sizes, where YOLOX achieves consis-
tent improvements against all the corresponding counter-
parts.

and the counterparts in terms of AP (%) on COCO val. All

Modified CSPNet in YOLOv5 To give a fair compar-
ison, we adopt the exact YOLOv5’s backbone including
modified CSPNet [31], SiLU activation, and the PAN [19]
head. We also follow its scaling rule to product YOLOX-
S, YOLOX-M, YOLOX-L, and YOLOX-X models. Com-
pared to YOLOv5 in Tab. 3, our models get consistent im-
provement by ∼3.0% to ∼1.0% AP, with only marginal
time increasing (comes from the decoupled head).
Tiny and Nano detectors We further shrink our model
as YOLOX-Tiny to compare with YOLOv4-Tiny [30]. For
mobile devices, we adopt depth wise convolution to con-
struct a YOLOX-Nano model, which has only 0.91M pa-
rameters and 1.08G FLOPs. As shown in Tab. 4, YOLOX
performs well with even smaller model size than the coun-
terparts.
Model size and data augmentation In our experiments,
all the models keep almost the same learning schedule and
optimizing parameters as depicted in 2.1. However, we
found that the suitable augmentation strategy varies across
different size of models. As Tab. 5 shows, while apply-
ing MixUp for YOLOX-L can improve AP by 0.9%, it is
better to weaken the augmentation for small models like
YOLOX-Nano. Specifically, we remove the mix up aug-
mentation and weaken the mosaic (reduce the scale range
from [0.1, 2.0] to [0.5, 1.5]) when training small models,
i.e., YOLOX-S, YOLOX-Tiny, and YOLOX-Nano. Such a
modification improves YOLOX-Nano’s AP from 24.0% to
25.3%.
For large models, we also found that stronger augmenta-
tion is more helpful. Indeed, our MixUp implementation is
part of heavier than the original version in [38]. Inspired
by Copypaste [6], we jittered both images by a random sam-
pled scale factor before mixing up them. To understand the
power of Mixup with scale jittering, we compare it with
Copypaste on YOLOX-L. Noted that Copypaste requires
extra instance mask annotations while MixUp does not. But
as shown in Tab. 5, these two methods achieve competitive
performance, indicating that MixUp with scale jittering is a
qualified replacement for Copypaste when no instance mask
annotation is available.

3. Comparison with the SOTA
There is a tradition to show the SOTA comparing table as
in Tab. 6. However, keep in mind that the inference speed
of the models in this table is often uncontrolled, as speed
varies with software and hardware. We thus use the same
hardware and code base for all the YOLO series in Fig. 1,
plotting the somewhat controlled speed/accuracy curve.
We notice that there are some high performance YOLO
series with larger model sizes like Scale-YOLOv4 [30] and
YOLOv5-P6 [7]. And the current Transformer based detec-
tors [21] push the accuracy-SOTA to ∼60 AP. Due to the
time and resource limitation, we did not explore those im-
portant features in this report. However, they are already in
our scope.

Table 6: Comparison of the speed and accuracy of different object detectors on COCO 2017test-dev. We select all the models
trained on 300 epochs for fair comparison.
hind this metric is to jointly evaluate the output of the entire
perception stack at every time instant, forcing the stack to
consider the amount of streaming data that should be ig-
nored while computation is occurring [15]. We found that
the best trade-off point for the metric on 30 FPS data stream
is a powerful model with the inference time≤ 33ms. So we
adopt a YOLOX-L model with TensorRT to product our fi-
nal model for the challenge to win the 1st place. Please refer
to the challenge website5 for more details.
5. Conclusion
In this report, we present some experienced updates to
YOLO series, which forms a high-performance anchor-
free detector called YOLOX. Equipped with some re-
cent advanced detection techniques, i.e., decoupled head,
anchor-free, and advanced label assigning strategy, YOLOX
achieves a better trade-off between speed and accuracy than
other counterparts across all model sizes. It is remarkable
that we boost the architecture of YOLOv3, which is still
one of the most widely used detectors in industry due to
its broad compatibility, to 47.3% AP on COCO, surpassing
the current best practice by 3.0% AP. We hope this report
can help developers and researchers get better experience in
practical scenes.
