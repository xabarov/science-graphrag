Cascade R-CNN: Delving into High Quality Object Detection

## Abstract

In object detection, an intersection over union (IoU)
threshold is required to define positives and negatives. An
object detector , trained with low IoU threshold, e.g. 0.5,
usually produces noisy detections. However , detection per -
formance tends to degrade with increasing the IoU thresh-
olds. Two main factors are responsible for this: 1) over-
fitting during training, due to exponentially vanishing pos -
itive samples, and 2) inference-time mismatch between the
IoUs for which the detector is optimal and those of the in-
put hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architectu re,
the Cascade R-CNN, is proposed to address these prob-
lems. It consists of a sequence of detectors trained with
increasing IoU thresholds, to be sequentially more selec-
tive against close false positives. The detectors are train ed
stage by stage, leveraging the observation that the out-
put of a detector is a good distribution for training the
next higher quality detector . The resampling of progres-
sively improved hypotheses guarantees that all detectors
have a positive set of examples of equivalent size, reduc-
ing the overfitting problem. The same cascade procedure
is applied at inference, enabling a closer match between
the hypotheses and the detector quality of each stage. A
simple implementation of the Cascade R-CNN is shown to
surpass all single-model object detectors on the challeng-
ing COCO dataset. Experiments also show that the Cas-
cade R-CNN is widely applicable across detector architec-
tures, achieving consistent gains independently of the bas e-
line detector strength. The code will be made available at

## Body

1. Introduction
Object detection is a complex problem, requiring the so-
lution of two main tasks. First, the detector must solve the
recognition problem, to distinguish foreground objects from
background and assign them the proper object class labels.
Second, the detector must solve the localization problem, to
assign accurate bounding boxes to different objects. Both
of these are particularly difficult because the detector fac es

many “close” false positives, corresponding to “close but
not correct” bounding boxes. The detector must find the
true positives while suppressing these close false positiv es.
Many of the recently proposed object detectors are based
on the two-stage R-CNN framework [
12, 11, 27, 21], where
detection is framed as a multi-task learning problem that
combines classification and bounding box regression. Un-
like object recognition, an intersection over union (IoU)
threshold is required to define positives/negatives. How-
ever, the commonly used threshold values u, typically
u = 0 .5, establish quite a loose requirement for positives.
The resulting detectors frequently produce noisy bounding
boxes, as shown in Figure
1 (a). Hypotheses that most hu-
mans would consider close false positives frequently pass
the IoU ≥ 0.5 test. While the examples assembled under
the u = 0 .5 criterion are rich and diversified, they make
it difficult to train detectors that can effectively reject c lose
false positives.
In this work, we define the quality of an hypothesis as its
IoU with the ground truth, and the quality of the detector as
the IoU threshold u used to train it. The goal is to investi-
1

gate the, so far, poorly researched problem of learning high
quality object detectors, whose outputs contain few close
false positives, as shown in Figure
1 (b). The basic idea is
that a single detector can only be optimal for a single qual-
ity level. This is known in the cost-sensitive learning lite r-
ature [
7, 24], where the optimization of different points of
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) requires diff er-
ent loss functions. The main difference is that we consider
the optimization for a given IoU threshold, rather than fals e
positive rate.
The idea is illustrated by Figure
1 (c) and (d), which
present the localization and detection performance, respe c-
tively, of three detectors trained with IoU thresholds of
u = 0 .5, 0.6, 0.7. The localization performance is evalu-
ated as a function of the IoU of the input proposals, and
the detection performance as a function of IoU threshold,
as in COCO [
20]. Note that, in Figure 1 (c), each bounding
box regressor performs best for examples of IoU close to
the threshold that the detector was trained. This also holds
for detection performance, up to overfitting. Figure
1 (d)
shows that, the detector of u = 0 .5 outperforms the detec-
tor of u = 0 .6 for low IoU examples, underperforming it
at higher IoU levels. In general, a detector optimized at a
single IoU level is not necessarily optimal at other levels.
These observations suggest that higher quality detection r e-
quires a closer quality match between the detector and the
hypotheses that it processes. In general, a detector can onl y
have high quality if presented with high quality proposals.
However, to produce a high quality detector, it does not
suffice to simply increase u during training. In fact, as seen
for the detector of u = 0.7 of Figure
1 (d), this can degrade
detection performance. The problem is that the distributio n
of hypotheses out of a proposal detector is usually heavily
imbalanced towards low quality. In general, forcing larger
IoU thresholds leads to an exponentially smaller numbers
of positive training samples. This is particularly problem -
atic for neural networks, which are known to be very exam-
ple intensive, and makes the “high u” training strategy quite
prone to overfitting. Another difficulty is the mismatch be-
tween the quality of the detector and that of the testing hy-
potheses at inference. As shown in Figure
1, high quality
detectors are only necessarily optimal for high quality hy-
potheses. The detection could be suboptimal when they are
asked to work on the hypotheses of other quality levels.
In this paper, we propose a new detector architecture,
Cascade R-CNN, that addresses these problems. It is a
multi-stage extension of the R-CNN, where detector stages
deeper into the cascade are sequentially more selective
against close false positives. The cascade of R-CNN stages
are trained sequentially, using the output of one stage to
train the next. This is motivated by the observation that the
output IoU of a regressor is almost invariably better than
the input IoU. This observation can be made in Figure
1
(c), where all plots are above the gray line. It suggests that
the output of a detector trained with a certain IoU thresh-
old is a good distribution to train the detector of the next
higher IoU threshold. This is similar to boostrapping meth-
ods commonly used to assemble datasets in object detec-
tion literature [
31, 8]. The main difference is that the re-
sampling procedure of the Cascade R-CNN does not aim to
mine hard negatives. Instead, by adjusting bounding boxes,
each stage aims to find a good set of close false positives
for training the next stage. When operating in this man-
ner, a sequence of detectors adapted to increasingly higher
IoUs can beat the overfitting problem, and thus be effec-
tively trained. At inference, the same cascade procedure is
applied. The progressively improved hypotheses are bet-
ter matched to the increasing detector quality at each stage .
This enables higher detection accuracies, as suggested by
Figure
1 (c) and (d).
The Cascade R-CNN is quite simple to implement and
trained end-to-end. Our results show that a vanilla imple-
mentation, without any bells and whistles, surpasses all pr e-
vious state-of-the-art single-model detectors by a large mar-
gin, on the challenging COCO detection task [
20], espe-
cially under the higher quality evaluation metrics. In addi -
tion, the Cascade R-CNN can be built with any two-stage
object detector based on the R-CNN framework. We have
observed consistent gains (of 2 ∼ 4 points), at a marginal
increase in computation. This gain is independent of the
strength of the baseline object detectors. We thus believe
that this simple and effective detection architecture can b e
of interest for many object detection research efforts.
2. Related Work
Due to the success of the R-CNN [
12] architecture, the
two-stage formulation of the detection problems, by com-
bining a proposal detector and a region-wise classifier has
become predominant in the recent past. To reduce redun-
dant CNN computations in the R-CNN, the SPP-Net [
15]
and Fast-RCNN [11] introduced the idea of region-wise fea-
ture extraction, significantly speeding up the overall dete c-
tor. Later, the Faster-RCNN [ 27] achieved further speeds-
up by introducing a Region Proposal Network (RPN). This
architecture has become a leading object detection frame-
work. Some more recent works have extended it to address
various problems of detail. For example, the R-FCN [
4]
proposed efficient region-wise fully convolutions without
accuracy loss, to avoid the heavy region-wise CNN com-
putations of the Faster-RCNN; while the MS-CNN [
1] and
FPN [ 21] detect proposals at multiple output layers, so as
to alleviate the scale mismatch between the RPN receptive
fields and actual object size, for high-recall proposal dete c-
tion.
Alternatively, one-stage object detection architectures
have also become popular, mostly due to their computa-

tional efficiency. These architectures are close to the clas sic
sliding window strategy [ 31, 8]. YOLO [ 26] outputs very
sparse detection results by forwarding the input image once.
When implemented with an efficient backbone network, it
enables real time object detection with fair performance.
SSD [
23] detects objects in a way similar to the RPN [ 27],
but uses multiple feature maps at different resolutions to
cover objects at various scales. The main limitation of thes e
architectures is that their accuracies are typically below that
of two-stage detectors. Recently, RetinaNet [
22] was pro-
posed to address the extreme foreground-background class
imbalance in dense object detection, achieving better results
than state-of-the-art two-stage object detectors.
Some explorations in multi-stage object detection have
also been proposed. The multi-region detector [
9] intro-
duced iterative bounding box regression , where a R-CNN
is applied several times, to produce better bounding boxes.
CRAFT [
33] and AttractioNet [ 10] used a multi-stage pro-
cedure to generate accurate proposals, and forwarded them
to a Fast-RCNN. [
19, 25] embedded the classic cascade ar-
chitecture of [31] in object detection networks. [3] iterated a
detection and a segmentation task alternatively, for insta nce
segmentation.
3. Object Detection
In this paper, we extend the two-stage architecture of the
Faster-RCNN [
27, 21], shown in Figure 3 (a). The first stage
is a proposal sub-network (“H0”), applied to the entire im-
age, to produce preliminary detection hypotheses, known
as object proposals. In the second stage, these hypothe-
ses are then processed by a region-of-interest detection su b-
network (“H1”), denoted as detection head. A final classi-
fication score (“C”) and a bounding box (“B”) are assigned
to each hypothesis. We focus on modeling a multi-stage de-
tection sub-network, and adopt, but are not limited to, the
RPN [
27] for proposal detection.
3.1. Bounding Box Regression
A bounding box b = ( bx, by, bw, bh) contains the four
coordinates of an image patch x. The task of bounding box
regression is to regress a candidate bounding box b into a
target bounding box g, using a regressor f (x, b). This is
learned from a training sample {gi, bi}, so as to minimize
the bounding box risk
Rloc[f ] =
N∑
i=1
Lloc(f (xi, bi), gi), (1)
where Lloc was a L2 loss function in R-CNN [ 12], but up-
dated to a smoothed L1 loss function in Fast-RCNN [ 11].
To encourage a regression invariant to scale and location,

δw = log(gw/bw), δ h = log(gh/bh). (2)
Since bounding box regression usually performs minor ad-
justments on b, the numerical values of (
2) can be very
small. Hence, the risk of ( 1) is usually much smaller
than the classification risk. To improve the effectiveness
of multi-task learning, ∆ is usually normalized by its mean
and variance, i.e. δx is replaced by δ′
x = ( δx − μx)/σx.
This is widely used in the literature [
27, 1, 4, 21, 14].
Some works [9, 10, 16] have argued that a single regres-
sion step of f is insufficient for accurate localization. In-
stead, f is applied iteratively, as a post-processing step
f ′(x, b) = f ◦ f ◦ · · · ◦f (x, b), (3)
to refine a bounding box b. This is called iterative bound-
ing box regression , denoted as iterative BBox . It can be
implemented with the inference architecture of Figure 3 (b)
where all heads are the same. This idea, however, ignores
two problems. First, as shown in Figure
1, a regressor f
trained at u = 0 .5, is suboptimal for hypotheses of higher
IoUs. It actually degrades bounding boxes of IoU larger
than 0.85. Second, as shown in Figure 2, the distribution of
bounding boxes changes significantly after each iteration.
While the regressor is optimal for the initial distribution it
can be quite suboptimal after that. Due to these problems,
iterative BBox requires a fair amount of human engineer-
ing, in the form of proposal accumulation, box voting, etc.
[
9, 10, 16], and has somewhat unreliable gains. Usually,
there is no benefit beyond applying f twice.

background and the remaining the objects to detect. h(x) is
a M + 1-dimensional estimate of the posterior distribution
over classes, i.e. hk(x) = p(y = k|x), where y is the
class label. Given a training set (xi, yi), it is learned by
minimizing a classification risk
Rcls[h] =
N∑
i=1
Lcls(h(xi), yi), (4)
where Lcls is the classic cross-entropy loss.
3.3. Detection Quality
Since a bounding box usually includes an object and
some amount of background, it is difficult to determine if
a detection is positive or negative. This is usually address ed
by the IoU metric. If the IoU is above a threshold u, the
patch is considered an example of the class. Thus, the class
label of a hypothesis x is a function of u,
y =
{
gy, IoU (x, g) ≥ u
0, otherwise (5)
where gy is the class label of the ground truth object g. This
IoU threshold u defines the quality of a detector.
Object detection is challenging because, no matter
threshold, the detection setting is highly adversarial. Wh en
u is high, the positives contain less background, but it is dif-
ficult to assemble enough positive training examples. When
u is low, a richer and more diversified positive training set
is available, but the trained detector has little incentive to
reject close false positives. In general, it is very difficul t
to ask a single classifier to perform uniformly well over all
IoU levels. At inference, since the majority of the hypothe-
ses produced by a proposal detector, e.g. RPN [
27] or selec-
tive search [30], have low quality, the detector must be more
discriminant for lower quality hypotheses. A standard com-
promise between these conflicting requirements is to settle
on u = 0 .5. This, however, is a relatively low threshold,
leading to low quality detections that most humans consider
close false positives, as shown in Figure
1 (a).
A na ̈ ıve solution is to develop an ensemble of classifiers,
with the architecture of Figure 3 (c), optimized with a loss

Lcls(h(x), y) =

where U is a set of IoU thresholds. This is closely
related to the integral loss of [
34], in which U =
{0.5, 0.55, · · ·, 0.75}, designed to fit the evaluation metric
of the COCO challenge. By definition, the classifiers need
to be ensembled at inference. This solution fails to address
the problem that the different losses of (
6) operate on dif-
ferent numbers of positives. As shown in the first figure
of Figure
4, the set of positive samples decreases quickly
with u. This is particularly problematic because the high
quality classifiers are prone to overfitting. In addition, th ose
high quality classifiers are required to process proposals o f
overwhelming low quality at inference, for which they are
not optimized. Due to all this, the ensemble of (
6) fails to
achieve higher accuracy at most quality levels, and the ar-
chitecture has very little gain over that of Figure
3 (a).
4. Cascade R-CNN
In this section we introduce the proposed Cascade R-
CNN object detection architecture of Figure 3 (d).
4.1. Cascaded Bounding Box Regression
As seen in Figure 1 (c), it is very difficult to ask a single
regressor to perform perfectly uniformly at all quality lev -
els. The difficult regression task can be decomposed into
a sequence of simpler steps, inspired by the works of cas-
cade pose regression [
6] and face alignment [ 2, 32]. In the

Cascade R-CNN, it is framed as a cascaded regression prob-
lem, with the architecture of Figure
3 (d). This relies on a
cascade of specialized regressors
f (x, b) = fT ◦ fT − 1 ◦ · · · ◦f1(x, b), (7)
where T is the total number of cascade stages. Note that
each regressor ft in the cascade is optimized w.r .t.the sam-
ple distribution {bt} arriving at the corresponding stage, in-
stead of the initial distribution of {b1}. This cascade im-
proves hypotheses progressively.
It differs from the iterative BBox architecture of Figure
3 (b) in several ways. First, while iterative BBox is a post-
processing procedure used to improve bounding boxes, cas-
caded regression is a resampling procedure that changes the
distribution of hypotheses to be processed by the different
stages. Second, because it is used at both training and in-
ference, there is no discrepancy between training and infer -
ence distributions. Third, the multiple specialized regre s-
sors {fT , fT − 1, · · ·, f1} are optimized for the resampled
distributions of the different stages. This opposes to the
single f of (
3), which is only optimal for the initial distri-
bution. These differences enable more precise localizatio n
than iterative BBox, with no further human engineering.
As discussed in Section 3.1, ∆ = ( δx, δy, δw, δh) in (2)
needs to be normalized by its mean and variance for effec-
tive multi-task learning. After each regression stage, the se
statistics will evolve sequentially, as displayed in Figur e
2.
At training, the corresponding statistics are used to norma l-
ize ∆ at each stage.
4.2. Cascaded Detection
As shown in the left of Figure 4, the distribution of the
initial hypotheses, e.g. RPN proposals, is heavily tilted t o-
wards low quality. This inevitably induces ineffective learn-
ing of higher quality classifiers. The Cascade R-CNN ad-
dresses the problem by relying on cascade regression as a
resampling mechanism. This is is motivated by the fact that
in Figure
1 (c) all curves are above the diagonal gray line,
i.e. a bounding box regressor trained for a certain u tends
to produce bounding boxes of higher IoU. Hence, starting
from a set of examples (xi, bi), cascade regression succes-
sively resamples an example distribution (x′
i, b′
i) of higher
IoU. In this manner, it is possible to keep the set of posi-
tive examples of the successive stages at a roughly constant
size, even when the detector quality (IoU threshold) is in-
creased. This is illustrated in Figure
4, where the distribu-
tion tilts more heavily towards high quality examples after
each resampling step. Two consequences ensue. First, there
is no overfitting, since examples are plentiful at all levels .
Second, the detectors of the deeper stages are optimized for
higher IoU thresholds. Note that, some outliers are sequen-
tially removed by increasing IoU thresholds, as illustrate d
in Figure
2, enabling a better trained sequence of special-
ized detectors.
At each stage t, the R-CNN includes a classifier ht and
a regressor ft optimized for IoU threshold ut, where ut >
ut− 1. This is guaranteed by minimizing the loss
L(xt, g) = Lcls(ht(xt), yt) + λ[yt ≥ 1]Lloc(ft(xt, bt), g),
(8)
where bt = ft− 1(xt− 1, bt− 1), g is the ground truth object
for xt, λ = 1 the trade-off coefficient, [·] the indicator func-
tion, and yt is the label of xt given ut by ( 5). Unlike the
integral loss of (6), this guarantees a sequence of effectively
trained detectors of increasing quality. At inference, the
quality of the hypotheses is sequentially improved, by ap-
plications of the same cascade procedure, and higher qual-
ity detectors are only required to operate on higher quality
hypotheses. This enables high quality object detection, as
suggested by Figure
1 (c) and (d).
5. Experimental Results
The Cascade R-CNN was evaluated on MS-COCO 2017
[20], which contains ∼ 118k images for training, 5k for val-
idation (val) and ∼ 20k for testing without provided anno-
tations ( test-dev). The COCO-style Average Precision
(AP) averages AP across IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95
with an interval of 0.05. These evaluation metrics measure
the detection performance of various qualities. All models
were trained on COCO training set, and evaluated on val
set. Final results were also reported on test-dev set.
5.1. Implementation Details
All regressors are class agnostic for simplicity. All cas-
cade detection stages in Cascade R-CNN have the same ar-
chitecture, which is the head of the baseline detection net-
work. In total, Cascade R-CNN have four stages, one RPN
and three for detection with U = {0.5, 0.6, 0.7}, unless oth-
erwise noted. The sampling of the first detection stage fol-
lows [
11, 27]. In the following stages, resampling is imple-
mented by simply using the regressed outputs from the pre-
vious stage, as in Section
4.2. No data augmentation was
used except standard horizontal image flipping. Inference
was performed on a single image scale, with no further bells
and whistles. All baseline detectors were reimplemented
with Caffe [
18], on the same codebase for fair comparison.
5.1.1 Baseline Networks
To test the versatility of the Cascade R-CNN, experi-
ments were performed with three popular baseline detec-
tors: Faster-RCNN with backbone VGG-Net [
29], R-FCN
[4] and FPN [ 21] with ResNet backbone [ 16]. These base-
lines have a wide range of detection performances. Unless
noted, their default settings were used. End-to-end traini ng
was used instead of multi-step training.

tors at all cascade stages.
Faster-RCNN: The network head has two fully connected
layers. To reduce parameters, we used [
13] to prune less
important connections. 2048 units were retained per fully
connected layer and dropout layers were removed. Train-
ing started with a learning rate of 0.002, reduced by a factor
of 10 at 60k and 90k iterations, and stopped at 100k itera-
tions, on 2 synchronized GPUs, each holding 4 images per
iteration. 128 RoIs were used per image.
R-FCN: R-FCN adds a convolutional, a bounding box re-
gression, and a classification layer to the ResNet. All heads
of the Cascade R-CNN have this structure. Online hard
negative mining [
28] was not used. Training started with
a learning rate of 0.003, which was decreased by a factor of
10 at 160k and 240k iterations, and stopped at 280k itera-
tions, on 4 synchronized GPUs, each holding one image per
iteration. 256 RoIs were used per image.
FPN: Since no source code is publicly available yet
for FPN, our implementation details could be different.
RoIAlign [
14] was used for a stronger baseline. This is
denoted as FPN+ and was used in all ablation studies. As
usual, ResNet-50 was used for ablation studies, and ResNet-
101 for final detection. Training used a learning rate of
0.005 for 120k iterations and 0.0005 for the next 60k it-
erations, on 8 synchronized GPUs, each holding one image
per iteration. 256 RoIs were used per image.

{0.5, 0.6, 0.7}. The detector of u = 0.5 outperforms the de-
tector of u = 0 .6 at low IoU levels, but underperforms it at
higher levels. However, the detector of u = 0 .7 underper-
forms the other two. To understand why this happens, we
changed the quality of the proposals at inference. Figure
5 (b) shows the results obtained when ground truth bound-
ing boxes were added to the set of proposals. While all
detectors improve, the detector of u = 0 .7 has the largest
gains, achieving the best performance at almost all IoU lev-
els. These results suggest two conclusions. First, u = 0 .5
is not a good choice for precise detection, simply more ro-
bust to low quality proposals. Second, highly precise de-
tection requires hypotheses that match the detector qualit y.
Next, the original detector proposals were replaced by the
Cascade R-CNN proposals of higher quality ( u = 0 .6 and
u = 0.7 used the 2nd and 3rd stage proposals, respectively).
Figure
5 (a) also suggests that the performance of the two
detectors is significantly improved when the testing propos -
als closer match the detector quality.
Testing all Cascade R-CNN detectors at all cascade
stages produced similar observations. Figure 6 shows that
each detector was improved when used more precise hy-
potheses, while higher quality detector had larger gain. Fo r
example, the detector of u = 0 .7 performed poorly for the
low quality proposals of the 1st stage, but much better for
the more precise hypotheses available at the deeper cascade
stages. In addition, the jointly trained detectors of Figur e
6 outperformed the individually trained detectors of Figure
5 (a), even when the same proposals were used. This indi-
cates that the detectors are better trained within the Casca de
R-CNN framework.
5.3. Comparison with Iterative BBox and Integral Loss
In this section, we compare the Cascade R-CNN to it-
erative BBox and the integral loss detector. Iterative BBox
was implemented by applying the FPN+ baseline iteratively,
three times. The integral loss detector has the same num-
ber of classification heads as the Cascade R-CNN, with
U = {0.5, 0.6, 0.7}.

cates the ensemble of three classifiers on the 3rd stage propo sals.
Localization: The localization performances of cascade
regression and iterative BBox are compared in Figure 7 (a).
The use of a single regressor degrades localization for hy-
potheses of high IoU. This effect accumulates when the re-
gressor is applied iteratively, as in iterative BBox, and per-
formance actually drops. Note the very poor performance
of iterative BBox after 3 iterations. On the contrary, the cas-
cade regressor has better performance at later stages, out-
performing iterative BBox at almost all IoU levels.
Integral Loss: The detection performances of all classi-
fiers in the integral loss detector, sharing a single regressor,
are shown in Figure
7 (b). The classifier of u = 0 .6 is the
best at all IoU levels, while the classifier of u = 0 .7 is the
worst. The ensemble of all classifiers shows no visible gain.
Table 1 shows, both iterative BBox and integral loss de-
tector improve the baseline detector marginally. The cas-
cade R-CNN has the best performance for all evaluation
metrics. The gains are mild for low IoU thresholds but sig-
nificant for the higher ones.
5.4. Ablation Experiments
Ablation experiments were also performed.
Stage-wise Comparison: Table
2 summarizes stage per-
formance. The 1st stage already outperforms the baseline
detector, due to the benefits of multi-stage multi-task lear n-
ing. The 2nd stage improves performance substantially, and
the 3rd is equivalent to the 2nd. This differs from the inte-
gral loss detector, where the higher IOU classifier is rela-
tively weak. While the former (later) stage is better at low
(high) IoU metrics, the ensemble of all classifiers is the bes t
overall.
IoU Thresholds: A preliminary Cascade R-CNN was
trained using the same IoU threshold u = 0 .5 for all heads.
In this case, the stages differ only in the hypotheses they

receive. Each stage is trained with the corresponding hy-
potheses, i.e. accounting for the distributions of Figure
2.
The first row of Table 3 shows that the cascade improves on
the baseline detector. This suggests the importance of op-
timizing stages for the corresponding sample distribution s.
The second row shows that, by increasing the stage thresh-
old u, the detector can be made more selective against close
false positives and specialized for more precise hypotheses,
leading to additional gains. This supports the conclusions
of Section
4.2.
Regression Statistics: Exploiting the progressively up-
dated regression statistics, of Figure 2, helps the effective
multi-task learning of classification and regression. Its b en-
efit is noted by comparing the models with/without it in Ta-
ble
3. The learning is not sensitive to these statistics.
Number of Stages: The impact of the number of stages is
summarized in Table 4. Adding a second detection stage
significantly improves the baseline detector. Three detec-
tion stages still produce non-trivial improvement, but the
addition of a 4th stage ( u = 0 .75) led to a slight perfor-
mance decrease. Note, however, that while the overall AP
performance degrades, the four-stage cascade has the best
performance for high IoU levels. The three-stage cascade
achieves the best trade-off.
5.5. Comparison with the state­of­the­art
The Cascade R-CNN, based on FPN+ and ResNet-101
backbone, is compared to state-of-the-art single-model ob-
ject detectors in Table
5. The settings are as described in
Section 5.1.1, but a total of 280k training iterations were
run and the learning rate dropped at 160k and 240k itera-
tions. The number of RoIs was also increased to 512. The
first group of detectors on Table
5 are one-stage detectors,
the second group two-stage, and the last group multi-stage
(3-stages+RPN for the Cascade R-CNN). All the compared
state-of-the-art detectors were trained with u = 0 .5. It is

noted that our FPN+ implementation is better than the orig-
inal FPN [
21], providing a very strong baseline. In addition,
the extension from FPN+ to Cascade R-CNN improved per-
formance by ∼ 4 points. The Cascade R-CNN also outper-
formed all single-model detectors by a large margin, un-
der all evaluation metrics. This includes the single-model
entries of the COCO challenge winners in 2015 and 2016
(Faster R-CNN+++ [
16], and G-RMI [ 17]), and the very
recent Deformable R-FCN [ 5], RetinaNet [ 22] and Mask
R-CNN [14]. The best multi-stage detector on COCO, At-
tractioNet [ 10], used iterative BBox for proposal genera-
tion. Although many enhancements were used in Attrac-
tioNet, the vanilla Cascade R-CNN still outperforms it by
7.1 points. Note that, unlike Mask R-CNN, no segmenta-
tion information is exploited in the Cascade R-CNN. Fi-
nally, the vanilla single-model Cascade R-CNN also sur-
passes the heavily engineered ensemble detectors that won
the COCO challenge in 2015 and 2016 (AP 37.4 and 41.6,
respectively)

5.6. Generalization Capacity
Three-stage Cascade R-CNN of all three baseline detec-
tors are compared in Table 6. All settings are as above, with
the changes of Section 5.5 for FPN+.
1http://cocodataset.org/#detections-leaderboard
Detection Performance: Again, our implementations are
better than the original detectors [ 27, 4, 21]. Still, the Cas-
cade R-CNN improves on these baselines consistently by
2∼ 4 points, independently of their strength. These gains
are also consistent on val and test-dev. These results
suggest that the Cascade R-CNN is widely applicable across
detector architectures.
Parameter and Timing: The number of the Cascade R-
CNN parameters increases with the number of cascade
stages. The increase is linear in the parameter number of
the baseline detector heads. In addition, because the com-
putational cost of a detection head is usually small when
compared to the RPN, the computational overhead of the
Cascade R-CNN is small, at both training and testing.
6. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a multi-stage object detec-
tion framework, the Cascade R-CNN, for the design of high
quality object detectors. This architecture was shown to
avoid the problems of overfitting at training and quality
mismatch at inference. The solid and consistent detection
improvements of the Cascade R-CNN on the challenging
COCO dataset suggest the modeling and understanding of
various concurring factors are required to advance object

detection. The Cascade R-CNN was shown to be applica-
ble to many object detection architectures. We believe that
it can be useful to many future object detection research ef-
forts.
